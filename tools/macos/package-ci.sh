DarkEden client - experimental macOS $platform CI build

Built and tested on macOS 15 using the macos Debug preset, without sanitizers.
Use macOS 15 or later on $platform.
This is a bare command-line executable, not a notarized .app bundle.
Desktop rendering, audio, IME and live-server gameplay have not been verified.

Install runtime libraries using native Homebrew at $brew_prefix:
  brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_ttf sdl2_mixer jpeg-turbo

Extract runtime assets v2 into this directory, so Data/ is beside DarkEden:
  https://github.com/bound2/opendarkeden-client/releases/tag/assets-v2
Existing UserSet/ settings can be retained. Assets and account settings are
not included. Open Terminal, cd to this writable game directory, then run:
  ./DarkEden

BUILD-INFO.txt records the exact source revision and build environment.
DEPENDENCIES.txt records the linked runtime libraries; they are not bundled.
