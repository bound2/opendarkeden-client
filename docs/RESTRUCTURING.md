# Client Restructuring Plan

**Original plan complete as of 2026-09-09.** Its tasks are `done` and have their owners;
PRs #144 and #145 carry the last slices. What the plan leaves behind is the
machinery, not a to-do list: the membership files, the include checker, the
ratchets and the fix policy (task 3.1) are what keep the end state
true from here, and *What the review rounds settled* is what a later slice
of any kind should read first. 5.2's *Candidates for a next slice* - dead
code the plan found and did not take unasked - was the last list open and
closed on 2026-09-16 with the eleventh slice; what still shrinks is the
exemption list, whenever a task extracts a seam. Further game-model extractions
are tracked under Phase 4; task 4.5 continues that work with the rank-bonus table.

Living, trackable plan for moving the OpenDarkEden client's game code out of the
`DarkEden` executable and into testable static libraries, while the outstanding
findings of `docs/code-health-review-2026-08-29.md` keep getting fixed. The end
state: **a fix that touches library code ships with a unit test in the same
commit; code that cannot be tested is a shrinking, named exception rather than
the default.**

This mirrors the server repo's `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` (same parent directory,
`../server`), which has already executed the exact refactoring this client
needs on its half of the shared codebase: `execute()` stripped off the packet
classes, a dispatch table at the composition root, the whole wire layer
compiled once into a standalone `de-kernel` library, membership held by a file
and enforced by an include-graph checker, and legacy debt tracked by
shrink-only ratchets. Where a task here has a proven server twin, the task
cites it — read the server's status notes before starting, because its
adversarial reviews recorded the traps.

## How to use this document

- Every task has a checkbox and a `> **Status:**` line. Update the status line
  **in the same commit** as the work it describes. Allowed values:
  `not started` | `in progress (<what remains>)` | `done (<commit>)` |
  `dropped (<why>)`.
- A status line records the **current** state and what the next reader
  needs to act: the owner, the conventions the reviews settled, the open
  bugs, what remains. The per-change narrative — what moved, what the
  review round found, the test list, the suite count, the ratchet delta —
  belongs in the PR description and the commit message, not here. PRs #33
  through #77, then #142 to #145, and their commits hold that history for
  everything below.
- A task is only `done` when its **Owner** exists — the test or mechanism that
  keeps the rule true from then on. Landing the change without the owner is
  `in progress (owner missing)`.
- Ratchet numbers only go **down**. Re-measure with the given command before
  and after a change that claims progress; commit the updated number with the
  change. A recorded growth (a split that adds an executable translation
  unit) moves the baseline with the reason written beside it.
- Substantial tasks get an **adversarial review** before merge (two
  reviewers; standing practice in this repo — every round so far has found
  real defects in the change itself).
- Verification for every extraction: both Debug trees build
  (`build/vs2022` with /RTC1, `build/vs2022-asan` with ASan), the test suite
  is green in a plain tree **and** an ASan tree, `wire_inventory_fresh`
  passes, and the applicable CI checks pass. **Live-server verification is
  optional, not a merge or completion gate** (user instruction, 2026-09-17).
  Do not wait for a runtime report or request one as approval to merge.
  Do not launch `DarkEden.exe` yourself unless the user asks.

### Working agreements for refactoring agents

- **New library targets use explicit source lists, never `file(GLOB)`.** The
  existing globs don't use `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`, so a moved file silently stays
  in the old target until someone reconfigures; explicit lists make membership
  reviewable and are what the ratchet script parses. After moving files,
  reconfigure both trees.
- **Moving a file between targets must not change its bytes** in the same
  commit when it has no seam to cut. Move first, prove the build, then fix —
  separate commits, so the diff that changes behavior is readable. A file
  that only links once its reaches go through a host moves and cuts in one
  commit (the Phase 4 pattern), and that commit names every change that is
  not the move.
- Sources are CRLF; use the Edit tool, not `sed -i`/`awk`, to modify them.
- Wire layout is pinned: any change under `Client/Packet` that touches
  `read()`/`write()`/`getPacketMaxSize()` must keep
  `tests/wire-layout.txt` in sync (regenerate via
  `tests/tools/gen_wire_inventory.pl`, re-record with `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1`) and
  must be diffed against the server with
  `server/tests/tools/wire_inventory_diff.sh`. A layout change is a protocol
  change and needs the identical change in the server repo.

### What the review rounds settled

Each of these cost at least one review finding; they are the rules the
per-task status lines no longer restate.

- **Measure the value, not the spelling.** A checker that matches
  `array[pPacket->getSlotID()]` misses the hundred sites that copy the
  value into a local first; one that hardcodes a receiver name misses the
  handlers that call it something else. `check_packet_indices.pl` walks
  the value; R7 and R8 exist as a pair because R7 counts a spelling.
- **A ratchet at zero is a claim about the ratchet.** R7 reached 0 and was
  read as finding C19 closed while 24 live sites used an entry copied into
  a static array first. Anything stronger than "the pattern sees nothing"
  needs a different instrument, and a new instrument gets the same
  adversarial reading as the code — it will not get it from the person who
  just built it (R8 was recorded at 13, and the population was 43).
- **A checker pins its own denominator.** `check_format_arity.pl` passed
  three times while checking nothing (a Perl list assignment, `find(1)`
  under PowerShell, a `//` inside a string literal). Both the sites it
  finds and the sites it resolves are floors now; every way a scan can
  shrink must fail rather than report a smaller number and exit 0.
- **A search that finds nothing is a fact about the search.** A grep that
  excludes the name it is searching for (`grep RenderText | grep -v
  TextService`, when every call is `TextService::RenderText`); a per-file
  grep over CP949 sources, which grep classifies as binary and stops
  reading silently; a grep for `#define __USE_ENCRYPTER__` that missed the
  define in `Encrypter.h` while the golden tests already said the branch
  was live. Read what the tests say before declaring code dead.
- **A link proof takes the address of non-virtual members.** A pointer to
  a virtual member is a vtable index and need not reference the defining
  object, so such a proof links cleanly with the file removed from the
  library. Verify a link proof by taking the file back out.
- **Scripted rewrites bound their patterns and are followed by a comment
  sweep.** A non-greedy `.*?` under `/s` swallowed 87 lines of `GameUI.cpp`
  into one argument; the ratchets could not have caught it, because a
  corrupted file has the right number of sites. After a scripted removal,
  sweep for orphaned banners and `//#include` lines.
- **Uninitialised members are reproduced, not guarded.** `/RTC1` fills
  stack locals with `0xCC` and the CRT fills heap with `0xCD`, so a test
  that reads a fresh object fails deterministically; but neither `/RTC1`
  nor ASan flags an uninitialised *member*, so the test reads the fill
  pattern rather than waiting for a crash. Every `gamemodel` slice found
  at least one constructor that set every field but a few.
- **A host entry answers without a host with the value a missing config
  would give, never zero.** A test binary, or a host whose entries are
  NULL, gets the `ClientConfig` constructor's defaults; a missing clock
  means no delay; a missing player means a skipped refresh rather than a
  crash — recorded as a behaviour delta where the old code dereferenced
  unguarded. Host readers are private statics on the class (`MItem::Clock()`),
  guard the function pointer, and are re-read on every call, never cached.
- **A host installer is designated-initialised.** When `WireHost` reached
  24 entries, fourteen shared a signature with another, and the
  executable that installs them is never linked into a test, so a
  positional slip compiled and passed the whole suite; the fourth slice
  recorded the order as "checked by reading". C++20 designators make an
  entry in the wrong slot, or one that does not exist, a compile error.
  What they cannot check is the body an entry points at.
- **A reference on a live line can still be dead.** The whisper seam was
  described as live behaviour because the code that reaches it is
  compiled; every path *to* that code sits behind `0 &&`. Before
  describing what a seam does, find the caller that runs.
- **A class split across a library and the executable** costs nothing when
  the class has no virtuals (`MSkillSet`, `TextService`) or when the
  library constructs none of the split classes (`MBomb`, `MHolyWater`), and
  is otherwise a vtable referencing symbols a test binary cannot link, so
  the class moves whole.
- **Every fix commit names its `Test path:`** (`lib + test`, `moved, then
  fixed`, `exempt`); a fix that could not be reproduced is a *regression
  guard* in its message, not a reproduction. `tools/git-hooks/commit-msg`
  refuses a `fix:` without one.
- **Two ratchets on the same finding see different things.** R3 counts
  `sprintf` lines but `\b` rejects the `w` in `wsprintf`; R7 counts both.
  R4 greps `g_p*` and cannot see a library file calling an executable-side
  *function* (which is what the link proofs are for) or a global under
  another name (`g_Mode`). Read each ratchet's comment for what it cannot
  see before quoting its number.

## Goals / non-goals

**Goals**

1. **Every new fix is unit-tested.** The code a fix touches gets moved into
   (or already lives in) a static library linked by `unit_tests`, and the fix
   is written test-first. Exceptions are named in the exemption list below,
   not decided ad hoc.
2. **The wire layer becomes a standalone library** (`packetwire`): streams,
   encrypter, info classes, and eventually all packet classes — so the #1
   open risk (unvalidated server input in `Client/Packet/Gpackets/`,
   code-health review priority 1) becomes directly testable with hostile
   inputs instead of only greppable.
3. **Game-model logic leaves the executable** piecewise (tables, inventories,
   price/trade logic), cutting `g_p*` global seams as it goes.
4. Architecture rules owned by tests (membership files, include-graph
   checker, ratchets), never by memory.

**Non-goals**

- No behavior change on the wire or in game rules unless a task says so
  explicitly. Layout stays pinned by the wire inventory + the server diff.
- No rewrite of the render/game loop (`GameMain.cpp`, `MZone` drawing,
  `GameUI.cpp`) or the VS_UI widget tree. These stay executable-or-UI-side
  and are covered by builds and available regression checks; runtime
  verification is optional.
- No new test framework. `tests/framework/test_framework.h` stays; tests are
  files in `tests/unit/` (globbed — reconfigure after adding one).
- Not a port of the server's kernel wholesale: the two repos stay separate
  codebases pinned to one wire contract by the shared inventory.

## Exemption list (tangled, outside the unit-test libraries)

Code on this list is fixed executable-side with build verification, available
automated checks and a **regression guard** note in the commit message when
the defect was not reproduced. Live-server verification is optional.
Shrink it when a task extracts a seam, and record the removal here.

| Code | Why exempt |
|---|---|
| `GameMain.cpp`, `GameInit.cpp`, `GameUI.cpp`, `Client.cpp`, `SDLMain.cpp` | process lifecycle, DLL whitelist, render loop and quest UI events; also where the hosts (`MItemHost`, `MPriceHost`, `WireHost`) are installed, which no test can prove - `WireHost`'s installer is designated-initialised since 2026-09-09, so a wrong slot there is a compile error, but a wrong *body* still is not |
| `MZone` live sector allocation/application, rendering and visual-effect ownership / `TileRenderer` draw paths | map parsing is tested in `ZoneMapData`; application and effects reach live sectors, creature status, sprite tables and `MTopView`; drawing uses live surfaces. Viewer tools cover some drawing; ownership guards use full builds and source-path audits. |
| `MCreature`, `MPlayer`, `MFakeCreature` movement and attached-effect orchestration; `PacketFunction::ExecuteActionInfoFromMainNode` | virtual character classes reach the live zone, UI, sprite tables and effect generators; action results transfer to `MEffectTarget` and execute through the same game objects. Bounds/queue/ownership guards stay here; extracting those classes would require the render/game-loop rewrite excluded above. Review regression guards use full builds and existing automated checks, without a runtime gate. |
| `VS_UI/src/**` rendering and dialogs that still reach game globals | these paths use full builds and available automated checks; live verification is optional. `ui_tests` now links the real Button, EventButton, SkinManager, LineEditor, LineEditorVisual state/focus methods, InputFocusManager and the UI result receiver, so those independently reachable components require test-first fixes. `LineEditorVisual::Show` remains separate because it reaches the game's renderer. |
| `Client/PacketHandler/*Handler.cpp` bodies | mutate `g_pZone`/creature state; the *parsers* they consume are in `packetwire` and testable, the mutations are not |
| `UIMessageManager::Execute_UI_CHAT_RETURN` | application chat callback reaches the current game mode, player, party/guild state, live socket, help events and dialogs. Its payload borrowing is source-audited with full builds; the queue that owns deferred text is independently tested in `ui_tests`. |
| `Client/MinTr.h` trace command transport | inline application diagnostics send Win32 window messages; command formatting uses explicit array capacity and source/build regression guards. Other legacy vararg trace functions remain counted by R8. |
| `PacketFunction.cpp` connect paths | Winsock + connection state machine. `RequestClientPlayerManager.cpp` was listed here until 2026-09-09; task 5.1's fifth slice put its seams behind `WireHost`, and task 5.2's eighth slice deleted it with the rest of the outbound peer side |
| The executable halves of split classes: `MItemUse.cpp`, `MObjectScreen.cpp`, `MSkillAvailable.cpp`, `TextServiceScreen.cpp` | the packet/dialog/drawing side of a class whose core is in a library, by design |

`UserOption` persistence is compiled once in `VS_UI/src/UserOption.cpp`.
`user_option_tests` links that library object and exercises the real settings
reader/writer together with `KeyAccelerator`; persistence fixes are test-first.

`SlayerPortalData` parses the portal resource independently of the dialog.
`test_portal_data.cpp` links the production reader and covers truncation, field
and count bounds, little-endian unaligned input and atomic replacement. The
dialog's sprite coordinates, zone filtering and navigation remain UI exemptions.

Everything else under `Client/*.cpp` and `Client/Packet/**` is presumed
movable until a task proves otherwise and adds it here with a reason.

## Ratchets (shrink-only)

Compiler warnings also have a shared target policy and a clean-build budget
checker in `tools/ci/check-warnings.pl` ([operation](../tools/ci/warnings.md)).
The generated target-option inventory and parser fixtures own the mechanism;
measured budgets cover all ten CI preset/architecture combinations. Every
increase fails, and a decrease requires tightening the committed budget.

`tests/ratchet/ratchets.sh` (ctest `ratchets`) holds the baselines inline
and fails the suite when a count **rises** or drops unrecorded, so
tightening lands in the same commit as the progress. Measurements are
grep-only by design; nothing is generated or overwritten. The script's
comment on each ratchet says what it cannot see and keeps the history of
every baseline move; the table below is the current reading.

| # | Metric | Now | What it counts, and does not |
|---|--------|---:|---|
| R1 | Translation units compiled directly into the `DarkEden` target | **467** | `grep -c "<ClCompile Include" build/vs2022/DarkEden.vcxproj`, read from the ctest run's own build dir; SKIP (never PASS) without a supported generated project. Both the Visual Studio configure stamp and Ninja's `build.ninja` must be newer than CMakeLists.txt and both library membership files. Ninja's baseline is **465**, since the non-Windows source list is two files shorter; Linux/macOS CI verifies that count. Baseline 1,044 on 2026-09-01; 484 after task 5.2's eighth slice. **482 on 2026-09-17:** the earlier deletion of `md5.cpp` had left the recorded 484 one too high (483 measured before this extraction); task 4.5 moves `RankBonusTable.cpp` into `gamemodel` (483 → 482). **478 later that day:** delete the four unused Direct3D texture/shadow cache translation units; their object declarations were commented out and the active sprite path never constructed them. **477 later still:** remove the unused Windows-only WinINet downloader; Ninja remains 475. It counts what still cannot be unit-tested. Recorded growths, each the executable side of a split: `PacketHandlerRegistry.cpp`, `GCExchangeBuyHandler.cpp`, `MItemUse.cpp`, `MObjectScreen.cpp`, `MSkillAvailable.cpp`, `TextServiceScreen.cpp`. **473 Windows / 471 Ninja later that day:** six map-record/header translation units move to `gamemodel`, while two new executable files retain screen geometry and live interaction actions; `ShowTimeChecker`'s pure constructor and I/O move to `ShowTimeData.cpp`. A further executable unit moved to `basic` with `CMessageArray` (2026-09-18). **470 Windows / 468 Ninja on 2026-09-21:** `UserOption.cpp` moves unchanged into `VS_UI`; its test links the same object as the game. **469 Windows / 467 Ninja:** the corrected `SXml.cpp` moves unchanged into `VS_UI`, replacing the older duplicate and allowing XML tests to link the production implementation. **468 Windows / 466 Ninja:** the help-message loader moves unchanged into `VS_UI` for real-library parser tests. **467 on 2026-09-21:** `CToken.cpp` joins `gamemodel` byte-identically so token and reset lifetimes can be tested. |
| R2 | Packet `.cpp` files still defining a packet-style `::execute(Player` | **0** | `grep -rlE '^void\s+\w+::execute\s*\(\s*Player' Client/Packet/{Gpackets,Cpackets,Lpackets,Rpackets,Upackets} --include='*.cpp' \| grep -v Handler \| wc -l`. Baseline 448. Holds the line since `Packet::execute` itself was deleted; the client twin of the server's R4. |
| R3 | Live `sprintf`/`strcpy`/`strcat` lines under `Client/Packet` and `Client/PacketHandler` | **0** | Line-based; strips `//` tails before matching, so a commented-out call does not count. `\b` rejects the `w` in `wsprintf`, which R7 sees instead. Baseline 61 (a quarter of it commented-out code). Holds the line since the packet-tree copy pass (2026-09-04, PR #76). |
| R4 | Library-compiled `.cpp` files referencing `g_p*` client globals no library file defines | **11** | Over the library dirs (minus CMake-excluded files) plus the `packetwire` and `gamemodel` membership files; comment lines excluded; the subtraction is library-wide, so a library file reading a global another library defines is not a seam. **All 11 are `VS_UI` files.** Blind to a library file calling an executable-side *function* (the link proofs cover that) and to a global not named `g_p*`. Baseline 83. **20 on 2026-09-18:** the editor uses the common TextService-backed printer, removing its direct `g_pLast`/`g_pBack` declarations. The printer still reaches game state; this is a reduction in direct references, not a claim that rendering is independent. **10 on 2026-09-21:** moving `UserOption` and `g_pUserOption` into `VS_UI` makes ten existing UI files resolve their only executable-owned global within the library; an ownership reclassification, not ten further file extractions. The text-mode scan now includes the NUL-bearing `VS_UI_GameCommon.cpp` on every platform: **11** is the corrected count; GNU grep previously omitted that file while BSD grep counted it. |
| R5 | Direct packet `execute()` call sites outside `Client/Packet` | **1** | A commented-out block in `CGameUpdate.cpp`. Added when the 2.2 review found the client fabricates packets locally and calls `execute()` on them; a live caller is a compile error now, before it is a ratchet failure. |
| R6 | *retired* — `packetwire` members calling `SendBugReport` | — | Lived one slice (2026-09-03). Added to replace the failed-link detector that stubbing the symbol had disabled; fired on the next promotion (count 2), which said "move the function, not the seam". `SendBugReport` is in `Client/Packet/WireHost.cpp`, the stub is gone, and the link is the detector again — narrower, since a link catches a call only in a library `unit_tests` links and in an object a test pulls in, which is what the address-taking link proofs in `test_wire_host.cpp` and `test_player_base.cpp` guarantee. |
| R7 | Call sites handing a game string table entry to a printf as its **format**, where the lookup is spelled at the call site | **0** | Five alternatives: the `sprintf` family (`fprintf` included), the size-taking family, `AddFormat`, the offset-append form `sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), …)`, and `.Format` (`MString::Format` is a printf reached as a method). The tree is joined before matching because sites put destination and format on different lines. **Blind to indirection**: an entry copied into a static array or a local first is invisible. Baseline 293; holds the line since PR #71. On its own it is not a measure of finding C19. |
| R8 | printf-family calls whose **format argument is not a string literal**, across `Client`, `VS_UI` and `basic`, headers included | **40** | The population R7 measures a spelling of; it cannot tell a table entry from a legitimate forward, so renaming cannot satisfy it. The 40 were read: 27 vararg forwarders, 6 inside `SafeFormat`'s `Emit`, 2 literals behind `TEXT()`/`_T()`, 5 declarations. The family list was enumerated from the tree (`fprintf`, `vswprintf` included). Cannot see a destination containing parentheses; those 16 sites were audited by hand, all literal formats. Added 2026-09-04 (PR #73). |
| R9 | Dynamic exception specifications (`throw()`, `throw(X, Y)`) under `basic/` | **0** | Not a removal: the first conformance slice went looking and found `basic/` had never carried one. The parentheses must hold type names or nothing, which is what tells a specification from a `throw` statement - the six live `throw ("...")` statements in the shop packets do not count, and neither does `throw Error(...)`. Blind to a type list it cannot spell (a template argument, a pointer, a comment between the parens), to a specification inside a `/* */` block, and to one behind a macro. The file list is asserted non-empty, so a renamed `basic/` fails instead of measuring 0 of nothing. Added 2026-09-06. |
| R10 | The same, across the library set: `basic`, `Client/SpriteLib`, `Client/TextSystem`, `Client/DXLib`, `Client/framelib` and `VS_UI` as whole trees, the `gamemodel` membership file, the `packetwire` membership file **and every `.h` under `Client/Packet`** | **0** | All of it is the packet tree - every other library is already at 0. 2,211 in the membership file's `.cpp` and 9,252 in the headers, over 1,042 of the set's 1,473 files; 8,528 empty `throw()` and 2,971 type lists. The headers are in the set because a specification is part of the function type, so a `.cpp`-only metric would have counted half of every edit as progress. Files are joined before matching: five specifications in `SocketAPI.cpp` span two lines, and line-based this set reads 11,494. Outside it, and the rest of the workload: `Client/PacketHandler` (284), the remaining executable sources (49) and `tests/` (9). Added 2026-09-06. **9,664 on 2026-09-07:** the 162 files directly under `Client/Packet` are at 0 - 143 carried a specification - and so is `tests/` (1,799 + 9 sites: the wire core, the packet framework and players, the info classes); ten destructors that carried a type list are spelled `noexcept(false)`, which the pattern does not count, and the remainder is the packet directories. **9,055 on 2026-09-07:** Lpackets, Upackets and Rpackets at 0 as well (609 sites, by script), leaving Cpackets and Gpackets. **5,883 on 2026-09-07:** Cpackets at 0 (3,172 sites, by script; the one packet that derives from another keeps its base unspecified), leaving Gpackets. **0 on 2026-09-07:** Gpackets at 0 (5,883 sites, by script; two packets deriving from GCChangeInventoryItemNum keep its getPacketSize unspecified). The library set is clean; what R10 never covered - `Client/PacketHandler` (284) and the executable sources (34) - is the next slice, with a ratchet of its own. |
| R11 | `register` storage-class specifiers in every `.cpp`, `.h` and `.inl` under `Client`, `VS_UI`, `basic`, `tools`, `third_party` and `tests` | **0** | Closed finding 4 of the assessment: 627 in 23 files removed 2026-09-07, all mechanical. Counted by `tests/tools/count_register.pl`, a tokenizer that strips comments and string literals per file, because the R9/R10 pipeline strips `/* */` before `//` and reads the blitters' `//*pDest = ...` line comments as block-comment openers (over the 23 files on master it saw 538 of the 627, a figure that moves with file order) and would count the NPC script strings that say "register as a couple". The `.c` files stay outside: they compile as C, where the keyword is valid. Added 2026-09-07. |
| R12 | Dynamic exception specifications anywhere: every `.h`, `.cpp` and `.inl` under `Client`, `VS_UI`, `basic`, `tools`, `third_party` and `tests` | **0** | R9 and R10 cover the libraries; this holds the executable side too, with the same pattern and blind spots. The last 319 outside the library set - 284 in `Client/PacketHandler` (one per handler `execute` definition), 32 in the two request-side packet factory managers, three in `RequestFileManager` and `Updater/UpdateManager.h` - went 2026-09-07, all type lists or `throw()` deleted, none promoted. Finding 3 of the assessment is closed on the source side. Added 2026-09-07. |
| R13 | Platform macros spelled outside `basic/Platform.h`: `__LINUX__`/`_LINUX` anywhere in the C++ tree, `PLATFORM_MACOS` outside `basic/`, and `PLATFORM_MACOS` in any CMake file | **1** | The port's build-contract slice (`docs/linux-macos-port-assessment-2026-09-07.md`, area A). Before it, four spellings of Linux coexisted and the build defined none - `__LINUX__` at 63 sites, so the socket and file APIs compiled neither their Windows nor their POSIX branch off Windows - while CMake handed every non-Windows target `PLATFORM_MACOS` in six places. `Platform.h` now detects the platform alone and adds `PLATFORM_POSIX`; the POSIX branches test that, and CMake passes no platform macro off Windows. `basic/` is exempt from the macOS count because `PlatformSDL.cpp`'s mach-o code is genuinely Darwin-only. The one counted use is the macOS font list in `TextBackendSDL.cpp`, a real Darwin branch; a second is a deliberate baseline change. Blind to the compiler builtins (`_WIN32`, `__APPLE__`, `__linux__`). Counted by `tests/tools/count_identifier.pl`, the register tokenizer generalised. Added 2026-09-08. |
| R14 | Live `GetTickCount()`/`timeGetTime()` calls under `Client` and `VS_UI` | **2** | The clocks work of the C++20 assessment (priority 5): the 32-bit tick wraps every 49.7 days, and every `previous + delay <= now` over it fires early or stalls across the wrap. Counted by `tests/tools/count_tick_reads.pl`, a character-level scanner over comments and string literals, because the regex strip the clocks slices first counted with reads a `//*` line comment as a block opener and swallows live code up to the next `*/` - the failure R11's tool was written for - and so missed the `srand(GetTickCount())` in `VS_UI_Item.cpp` outright (209 in 32 files where this reads 214 in 34). `basic/` is outside the count: its three hits are `Platform.h`'s definitions. Counts calls and definitions alike, so the 186 includes the non-Windows `GetTickCount` shim in `VS_UI_widget.h`, and counts `#if`-disabled code. 214 before the widget timers outside `GameCommon` moved to `MonotonicClock::IntervalTimer`; 100 of the 186 were the two `VS_UI_GameCommon` sources. Added 2026-09-10. **138 later that day:** the interval and window gates in those two sources moved (45 calls), the last `GetTickCount` in `VS_UI` with them - two `srand` seeds reseeded and the `VS_UI_widget.h` stub definition deleted make the 48; `VS_UI` holds 56 `timeGetTime()` sites in three files (the header's `SetTimer` is the third), four of them `srand` seeds and the rest deadline and elapsed-time shapes; `Client` 82. **113 later still:** the deadlines set and read within `VS_UI` and the flag-war end its handler sets moved to `TimePoint` (19 of the 25 calls; the gamble spin's two went to `IntervalTimer` and four are `srand` seeds reseeded from the same tick under another name); the two mission structs `VS_UI` had redeclared from the wire layer became typedefs of it; `VS_UI` holds 33 (the minigames' clocks and the three deadlines the executable sets through shared structs), `Client` 80. **93 on 2026-09-16:** the three minigames' clocks moved to `TimePoint` (20 calls): the minesweeper's start point and the elapsed time it keeps once a game ends (one `DWORD` had held both in turn), the arrow tile's per-character start, end and move points, a trap-delay point nothing sets, and its monster-move gate, and the crazy mine's start point; the elapsed millisecond counts reach the score message as before. `VS_UI` holds 13, the three deadlines the executable sets through shared structs; `Client` 80. **72 later that day:** those three deadlines moved with their setters (21 calls): the quest status's `quest_time` and the war list's `left_time` to `MonotonicClock::SecondPoint`, the whole-second point the `timeGetTime() / 1000` they were counted in floors to, the effect status's `delayFrame` to `TimePoint`. `VS_UI` holds no live call (a dozen mentions inside comments), `Client` 72. **53 later still:** the event register's start stamp (`MEvent::eventStartTickCount`, set by `AddEvent` and reset by the two ending cinematics in `MTopView` as each starts, read by the show-time blink, the expiry, the countdown captions, the scrolls, the fades and two dead script gates through one `ElapsedMillis()`) and the HP-modify list's stamp moved to `TimePoint` (19 calls) - a width and clock change only, since every read was a wrap-safe unsigned subtraction; `MTopView` holds 6, the quest event's parameter fields read as ticks; `MPlayer` 9 (two in its header, feeding the failing `previous + delay < now` shape), `MFakeCreature` 7. **35 later still:** the player's four stamps (the repeat and lock gates and the pet's dissection delay, all three the failing sum shape, and the trace limit, a subtraction), the fake creature's next-move deadline (sum-shaped too) and the two `PacketFunction` setters that fed them moved to `TimePoint` (18 calls); `MTopView` holds 6, the rest ones to fours. **10 on 2026-09-17:** the scatter (25 calls) - the wait screens' double-click gate and the game screen's write-only click stamp, the title fade's start, the `CGVerifyTime` deadline (sum-shaped, read against the frame clock), the update handler's loading stopwatch, the profiler's start stamp, the name window's send stamp (a tick parked in `TempInformation`'s generic `intptr_t` slot, now a `TimePoint` slot of its own), the reconnect handler's two `OUTPUT_DEBUG` stopwatches and the socket stream's byte-rate window (an `IntervalTimer`) moved to the monotonic clock, and `MTopView`'s six went with the quest caption they were in, a block no live event reaches. What is left is the frame clock (`g_CurrentTime`'s three live writers, `g_StartTime`, `CWinUpdate::m_CurrentTime`) and four calls that are not clocks: the two log-file names and the hack check that compares `timeGetTime()` against `GetTickCount()` on purpose. **5 on 2026-09-17:** the frame clock's first slice - one `StampFrameClock()` stamps `g_FrameNow`, a `TimePoint`, beside `g_CurrentTime` (the three writers call it), `CWinUpdate`'s clock members, which nothing outside the class read, are deleted with their two calls, and `g_StartTime` is a `TimePoint`; what is left is that one writer, the two log-file names and the hack check. R16 counts the readers of the `DWORD` from here. **4 on 2026-09-17:** the frame clock's `DWORD` and its writer are gone (the fifteenth slice); the four are the floor - two log-file names that are not clocks, and the hack check that compares two clocks on purpose. **2 later that day:** the code-health follow-up found the hack check was behind an unconditional return. Its body, call and unused timing state are deleted; only the two log-file names remain. |
| R15 | The five side macros the once-shared sources switched on (`__GAME_CLIENT__`, `__GAME_SERVER__`, `__LOGIN_SERVER__`, `__SHARED_SERVER__`, `__UPDATE_SERVER__`) and the four spellings no translation unit ever had defined that guarded dead code the same way (`__UPDATE_CLIENT__`, `__EXPO_CLIENT__`, `__FULLSCREEN_MODE__` - defined only inside a dead branch - and `__GUILD_MANAGER_TOOL__`): live tokens under `Client/Packet`, live tokens in the rest of the C++ tree, and the names anywhere in a `CMakeLists.txt` or `.cmake` file, three counts checked separately | **0**, **0**, **0** | `__GAME_CLIENT__` was defined for every translation unit that read it (from CMake on three targets and the listed test sources, from `Client_PCH.h` everywhere else) and the other four never were, so a conditional on any of them had one value in every translation unit. Task 5.2's ninth slice evaluated the 190 under `Client/Packet` out (2026-09-13), the tenth the 361 in the rest of the tree and then the definition itself, from `CMakeLists.txt`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt` and `Client_PCH.h` in one commit. The first count keeps a server half behind one of the five from coming back through a copy from the server repo unnoticed (one behind another spelling is the include checker's both-branch walk to catch); the second makes a `#ifdef __GAME_CLIENT__` written from habit fail the suite, since nothing defines it and the guarded code would be dead; the third keeps the name out of the CMake files, where a definition put back would make every such guard live again - matched without word boundaries, because `-D__GAME_CLIENT__` has a word character on each side of the name (the same hole was in R13's CMake count and is closed there too). All three counts pin their file counts (a baseline of 0 cannot notice a shrunken scan); the CMake count does not see `CMakePresets.json`, the workflows or the Makefile, none of which passes a macro today. Counted by `tests/tools/count_identifier.pl`, so a comment or a string does not count - "zero live tokens", never "zero mentions". Blind to a spelling assembled by the preprocessor; a `#define` of the macro in a source file is one token and fails the count. Added 2026-09-13; both source counts at 0 and the CMake count added later that day. **Nine names since 2026-09-16:** the eleventh slice took `__EXPO_CLIENT__` (ten sites) and `__UPDATE_CLIENT__` (one) out, and with them `__FULLSCREEN_MODE__`, which only `__EXPO_CLIENT__` ever defined; `__GUILD_MANAGER_TOOL__` was already at 0 (its three sites went with the tenth slice). 13 live tokens to 0 in the nine files; the pattern names all nine so a guard on any of them written from habit, or copied back, fails the suite the same way. |
| R16 | Live spellings of `g_CurrentTime`, the frame clock's `DWORD`, under `Client` and `VS_UI` | **0** | The frame clock's move (the twelfth clocks slice, 2026-09-17): `g_FrameNow`, a `MonotonicClock::TimePoint` stamped by the same `StampFrameClock()`, sits beside the `DWORD`, and the readers move over a group at a time - the `DWORD` and its one tick call go when this reaches its definition, declarations and writer alone. Counted by `tests/tools/count_identifier.pl` (comments and strings stripped), with a 1,000-file floor on the scan. 144 before the slice; the 57 are the creatures' and the player's member stamps, two of `UserInformation`'s three deadlines (a `gamemodel` member; `GlobalSayTime`'s reads are commented out), `MGameTime`'s two, the item host's clock pointer and the wire host's clock function (two library seams), the debug prints, the writer and the externs. **18 on 2026-09-17:** the creatures' and the player's member stamps moved (nine deadlines in `MCreature` and `MPlayer`, `MFakeCreature`'s inherited read) with their four extern declarations; what is left is `UserInformation`'s two live deadlines and their seven sites, `MGameTime`'s three spellings, the two seams, the definition, the write, one debug print and three externs. **6 on 2026-09-17:** `UserInformation`'s two live deadlines moved behind five small members with a test (`GlobalSayTime`, whose three uses are commented out, deleted) and `MGameTime`'s start and current time take the point; what is left is the two seams, the definition, the write, one debug print and the extern in `Client.h`. **0 on 2026-09-17:** the two seams carry a `TimePoint` (the item host's clock pointer, the wire host's clock function, with their tests and two legacy-wrap cases) and `g_CurrentTime` is deleted; the count stays as the guard that nothing brings the name back. |
| R17 | Unbounded format and copy lines (`sprintf`, `wsprintf`, `strcpy`, `strcat`) under `basic`, `VS_UI` and `Client` outside the packet tree | **568** | The bounded-formatting work of the C++20 assessment (priority 7): R3's grep with `wsprintf` added and headers scanned beside sources, over the rest of the tree, `//` tails stripped, read with `-a` for `VS_UI_GameCommon.cpp`'s NUL bytes. A site leaves it when its destination is a real array and the call is `snprintf(dst, sizeof(dst), ...)` or an exact-length `memcpy`, checked by hand. 1,102 before the first slice (2026-09-17), which took `basic` to 0 (`C_DIRECTORY`, unreferenced and unlinkable on Windows, deleted; PlatformSDL and SafeFormat bounded) and `SpriteLib` to 0; `VS_UI` holds 783, the rest of `Client` 303. **1,016 on 2026-09-17:** the second slice took ten Client utility files to zero (70 lines: `GetWinVersion` takes its buffer's size, `CMd5`, which nothing constructs, deleted with its two files (its 50-byte error text overflowed for a long path nothing supplied), `MMusic`'s error text becomes the `char` array it was cast to, the rest `snprintf(sizeof)` into local arrays, and sixteen lines of block-commented debug code deleted with their blocks). **970 on 2026-09-17:** the third slice took `Client.cpp`, `GameMain.cpp`, `MZone.cpp` and `MCreature.cpp` to zero (46 lines: three live overflows - the Futec parser's 32-byte argument slots, the 128-byte log-file name under a `_MAX_PATH` directory, the 80-byte server-group name from the login server's world list - three `sprintf` calls that read their own destination made appends, the rest `snprintf(sizeof)` or an exact-length `memcpy`, and fifteen dead lines - `get_rand_str` and thirteen block-commented debug dumps - deleted with their blocks). **969 later that day:** remove the unused WinINet downloader and its one `strcpy`. **966 on 2026-09-18:** move `CMessageArray` into `basic` and replace its three unbounded copies with owned filename storage and bounded row copies. **963 later that day:** delete three dead formatting lines with the abandoned GL drawing blocks. **587 on 2026-09-21:** all remaining raw `wsprintf` calls are bounded or removed with an unused API; R18 prevents their return. **586 later that day:** `CToken` replaces `strcpy` with an exact-length copy into owned replacement storage. **584 later that day:** team introduction and billing dialog wrapping replace whole-remainder `strcpy` calls with owned UTF-8 rows. **570 later that day:** descriptors use owned rows and remove the unused substitution buffers (14 counted copy lines). **569 later that day:** rich-help removes the unused substitution loop, including one counted dead copy. **568 later that day:** notice mail date formatting uses the checked formatter. |
| R18 | Raw `wsprintf`, `wsprintfA` and `wsprintfW` identifiers | **0** | `tests/tools/count_wsprintf.pl` scans tracked and unignored C/C++ sources and headers, masks comments/literals and joins line splices. It counts aliases as well as calls, pins the source inventory and checks its lexer fixtures. Token-pasted spellings are outside this source check; the POSIX shim is also deleted. |

R7 and R8 exist as a pair on purpose: R7 is precise and blind to
indirection, R8 is coarse and cannot be evaded by spelling. Finding C19's
closure rests on both plus the hand audits listed in the review's C19 entry,
never on either number alone.

**Two checkers sit beside the ratchets**, in `tests/tools/`, because what
they measure needs parsing rather than grepping. `check_format_arity.pl`
(ctest `format_arity`) compares every converted format site's arguments
against the built-in English table in `MGameStringTable.cpp` (which
`InitGameStringTable()` installs over the file data on the English path, so
it is what the default build formats with); it fails when an entry asks for
more arguments than the site passes or a conversion's argument is provably
the other kind, and it floors both the sites it finds (295) and the sites it
resolves (283). `check_packet_indices.pl` (ctest `packet_indices`) is the index
half of code-health priority 1: over `Client/Packet` and
`Client/PacketHandler` it walks packet-derived values into subscripts —
through locals, across lines, one hop — and reports **114**, 101 into a
named, verified `CTypeTable` and a ceiling of **13** into a container that
is not, all guarded today. Its range-checked list is a named allowlist that
fails closed (when introduced, `CMessageArray::operator[]` truncated rather
than checked; it gained bounds checks on 2026-09-18, but the spelling of a
dereference still cannot prove a container is checked); a fourteenth raw
subscript has to be read before the number moves.

## Phase 1 — `packetwire`: the wire-support library (pilot)

The first extraction, chosen so that no source file needed to change to
move (see *First candidate* at the end) and the result immediately covered
the top-risk area's foundations: streams, framing, crypto, sockets and the
info classes the GC packets delegate their parsing to.

- [x] **1.1 Create the `packetwire` static library** from the game-free
  subset of the `Client/Packet` root.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #34; 51 files then, the whole wire
  > layer bar one file now — see 2.4 and 5.1). Membership is
  > `tests/arch/packetwire_files.txt`, read by CMake, the include checker
  > and the ratchet script; the executable's list drops members by
  > absolute path. Build wiring: `__GAME_CLIENT__` from `Client_PCH.h`
  > (until task 5.2's tenth slice retired it),
  > `__WIN32__`/`__WINDOWS__` on WIN32, include dirs `Client/Packet`,
  > `Client`, `basic`; `DarkEden` and `VS_UI` link it.
  - Owner: the membership file + W0/W1/W2 in the include checker + R1.

- [x] **1.2 Link `packetwire` into `unit_tests`** and land the first parser
  tests. Stream construction in tests goes through a one-line
  `friend class SocketInputStreamTestAccess;` in the stream header
  (access-only, declared unconditionally so the class definition is
  identical in every TU); the helper is `tests/support/packet_stream_access.h`.
  Test TUs compile with the library's own defines (the Windows wire
  macros; `__GAME_CLIENT__=1` as well until task 5.2's tenth slice
  retired it): `Packet`'s virtual set changed under that one and the
  packet headers still switch on the others, so a mismatch is a real
  vtable/ODR break.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #34). Pinned: stream bounds
  > (zero-length rejected, over-read throws `InsufficientDataException`
  > and consumes nothing, wrap-around reassembly), the `read(std::string&,
  > len)` contract including the truncate-at-embedded-NUL-but-consume-
  > full-length asymmetry, `ModifyInfo` and `InventoryInfo` hostile
  > counts. The five allocate → read → push_back parser sites
  > (`InventoryInfo`, `GearInfo`, `ExtraInfo`, `RideMotorcycleInfo`,
  > `PCItemInfo`) push_back before read so a truncated payload does not
  > leak the in-flight slot — a regression guard, because MSVC's ASan
  > does no leak detection.
  - Owner: the tests themselves; `unit_tests` link line.

- [x] **1.3 First test-first fix: `StringStream` stack overflow.**
  `operator<<(float)` did `sprintf(buf, "%f", T)` into `char buf[12]`;
  `double` the same into `buf[22]`. The server fixed this family on its
  side (server RESTRUCTURING 1.4).
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #34). The nine-operator numeric
  > family uses `snprintf` with range-sized buffers (`double` 352 — `%f`
  > of `-DBL_MAX` is 317 characters), and `m_Size` is `size_t` (it was
  > `ushort` and wrapped at 64 KiB, which the widened entries made
  > reachable). Tests pin the exact formatting at each old overflow
  > threshold.
  - Owner: the unit test.

---

## Phase 2 — Strip `execute()`, move the packet classes

The client twin of the server's tasks 2.3/2.4: the migration recipe, the
dispatcher design and the traps are recorded in the server's status notes.
This is what makes the `Gpackets` parsers (priority 1 in the code-health
review) directly unit-testable.

- [x] **2.1 `PacketDispatcher` in `packetwire`.** Table of packet id →
  `void(*)(Packet*, Player*)`, written only at startup; the server's
  `PacketDispatcher.h` shape verbatim, `DE_REGISTER_PACKET_HANDLER` macros
  included.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #37). Fixed `PACKET_MAX` table,
  > unconditional throws on double registration and out-of-range ids,
  > `InvalidProtocolException` from `dispatch` on an unregistered id.
  > All four receive loops (`ClientPlayer`, `Player`,
  > `RequestServerPlayer` - `RequestClientPlayer` was a fifth until task
  > 5.2's eighth slice - and `ClientCommunicationManager` with a NULL
  > player) call
  > `PacketDispatcher::dispatch` unconditionally; the transitional
  > `tryDispatch` fallback was deleted with `Packet::execute` itself in
  > 2.4, so the base class carries no handler entry point, as on the
  > server.
  - Owner: R2 ratchet + the dispatcher unit tests.

- [x] **2.2 Migrate the GC direction** and
- [x] **2.3 Migrate CG / LC / CR-RC / U.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PRs #38 and #39). Every `execute()` body
  > in every direction was mechanically classified and stripped.
  > `Client/PacketHandlerRegistry.cpp` is the composition root, called
  > from `InitSocket()` (per login attempt), idempotent, its flag set
  > after success: the standard delegations, the packet-only handlers
  > (the datagram connection family), the `__BEGIN_DEBUG` thunks (kept
  > for the cout-branch platforms), `GLIncomingConnectionError`'s cout
  > trace, `GCExchangeList` and `CGConnectSetKey` as explicit no-ops.
  > The `DE_REGISTER` thunks carry `__BEGIN_TRY`/`__END_CATCH`, so the
  > per-packet stack-annotation frame the deleted bodies had is kept.
  > The 163 CG `execute()` bodies were deleted unregistered, with
  > `CGHandlersStub.cpp`; the honest basis, written in the registry
  > header: the server never sends CG/CL ids and the bodies were no-ops
  > (`PacketValidator`'s `CPS_NORMAL` accepts any id and
  > `Player::processCommand` has no validator, so the only change is
  > that a protocol-violating peer now disconnects — the server's trade).
  > **The receive loops were never the whole story**: the client
  > fabricates packets locally (skill echoes in `CGameUpdate.cpp`, GM
  > messages in `Client.cpp`, `CGConnectSetKey` on the login and
  > reconnect paths); all route through `PacketDispatcher::dispatch`
  > and R5 owns the rule.
  - Owner: R2 and R5 ratchets.

- [x] **2.4 Move the packet classes into `packetwire`**, plus
  `PacketFactoryManager` / `PacketValidator` / `PacketIDSet`; handlers move
  to `Client/PacketHandler/`, compiled into the exe, so `Client/Packet` is
  wire-only and the include checker locks the whole directory.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #41). Handlers moved by pure `git
  > mv` after one prep commit qualified their includes
  > (`"Gpackets/GCSay.h"`); the never-compiled CG handlers were deleted.
  > The last game reaches came out by seam: `CLLogin`'s
  > `g_pUserInformation` read is a packet member the sender sets,
  > `WHISPER_MESSAGE` sits beside `CRWhisper`, five root info classes
  > moved under `Client/Packet`, two dead `__GAME_SERVER__` bodies that
  > built wire fields from live game objects were deleted.
  > `PacketDiagnostics` is the hook through which `Datagram::read`
  > reports without linking the executable; since 5.1 it is an
  > interception point (how a test captures the text), and reporting goes
  > straight to the library's `SendBugReport` when no hook is installed.
  > **Goldens (the owner):** `test_packet_goldens.cpp` writes through the
  > real streams and pins the `.hex` files under `tests/golden/`, **54 of
  > them byte-identical copies of the server's** (all 19 encrypter packets at codes 0–5, GCMoveOK
  > framed, CGSay, CGWhisper) — `diff -r` of the two golden directories
  > is the cross-repo check. The first run found a real wire defect:
  > `CGMove` at encrypt code 0 wrote x,y,dir where the server reads
  > dir,x,y, and code 0 is reachable (the session code cancels for zone
  > 1301 in the shipped data); fixed on the client, the reading side
  > being the authority. Two asymmetries are pinned as fact-tests:
  > `CLLogin::read` here is one byte short of the login server's, and
  > `GCDropItemToZone` round-trips here while the server pins only its
  > `write()`. `test_packet_factories.cpp` proves the link for the
  > received directions and pins that the manager refuses CG and
  > out-of-range ids.
  > **Deliberately not done then** (task 5.2's ninth and tenth slices
  > took them on 2026-09-13): the ~186 `__GAME_SERVER__`/`__GAME_CLIENT__`
  > conditionals in 157 packet sources (they have one meaning in every
  > target, so the checker evaluates them; sweeping the dead server
  > halves is 5.2 work), and goldens for the ~500 unpinned packets.
  - Owner: W0/W1 over the whole `Client/Packet` tree; the goldens; the
    factory link test.

- [x] **2.5 Retire the wire-inventory workaround.** `test_wire_layout.cpp`
  calls the real factories instead of perl-lifted method bodies;
  `tests/wire-layout.txt` stays byte-compatible with the server's
  `wire_inventory_diff.sh`.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-02, PR #42). `tests/generated/WireInventory.inc`
  > has the server's registry shape (one include and one registration per
  > factory class; `gen_wire_inventory.pl` emits it, `wire_inventory_fresh`
  > pins it, and the generator refuses a `getPacketName()` spelling it
  > cannot check). The test constructs every factory and its packet (the
  > link proof for the written CG/CL directions), checks id uniqueness,
  > and checks every id `PacketFactoryManager::init()` serves is a listed
  > factory at its own max size. Rpackets are constructed but kept out of
  > the rendered file. Two divergences went first: 112 factory classes
  > had been compiled out of every client build (`__DEBUG_OUTPUT__`,
  > `__GAME_CLIENT__` guards) and are unconditional now, and `CRRequest2`,
  > a dead duplicate of `PACKET_CR_REQUEST`, is deleted. Two wire defects
  > found and fixed test-first: `GCUpdateInfo`'s constructor never
  > initialised `m_pBloodBibleSign` while its destructor deletes it (a
  > truncated body freed a garbage pointer); and `GCAddItemToItemVerify`
  > read two parameters for `UP_GRADE_OK` where the server writes one, so
  > every successful item-grade upgrade over-read four bytes into the next
  > packet (its `write()` also dropped both `THREE_ENCHANT_OK` parameters;
  > the handler now sets the grade the server sends). The other seven
  > packets a cross-repo sweep had flagged are identical layouts.
  - Owner: `wire_inventory_fresh`; the all-factory construction in
    `test_wire_layout.cpp`; the `GCAddItemToItemVerify` goldens.

**Phase exit criteria:** met — R2 = 0; `Client/Packet` contains no handler
code; parser fixes are written test-first against real packet objects;
live-server smoke tests passed per slice.

---

## Phase 3 — The fix policy (in force from Phase 1 onward)

Not a code phase — the standing rule this plan exists to enable, stated once:

- [x] **3.1 Every fix names its test path in the commit message.** One of:
  (a) *lib + test* — the code is in a static library and the fix commit
  contains the test; (b) *moved, then fixed* — the fix's first commit moves
  the unit into a library, the second fixes it test-first; (c) *exempt* —
  the code is on the exemption list, the commit says so and carries the

  - Owner: the hook.

The creature allocator is now directly testable in `basic/MemoryPool`, with
its four creature-specific pool instances retained in `Client/MemoryPool.cpp`.
`tests/unit/test_memory_pool.cpp` owns the size, alignment, membership and
reuse contracts; the move and the behavior change are separate commits.

## Phase 4 — Game-model extraction

Background work, one class family per branch, each independently mergeable.
Target library: `gamemodel` — links `basic` + `packetwire` + `framelib`
(+ iconv for `MString`), **no** SDL/dxlib/VS_UI. Membership is
`tests/arch/gamemodel_files.txt` (`.cpp` lines compiled, `.h` lines
allowed in the closure), read by CMake, which removes each member from the
executable by absolute path and asserts it, by the include checker (M0–M2)
and by the ratchet script (R4). Extraction means adding a file to that list
and cutting its `g_p*`/UI seams through a host struct the executable
installs at start-up (`MItemHost`, `MPriceHost`; see *What the review
rounds settled* for the host rules). Test fixtures share
`tests/support/gamemodel_world.h`.

- [x] **4.0 Compile the VS_UI client sources once.** The 36 `Client/*.cpp`
  files on `VS_UI_CLIENT_SOURCES` were compiled into both `VS_UI` and the
  executable (the list was relative, the exe's `REMOVE_ITEM` absolute, so
  it never matched — the LNK4217 noise CLAUDE.md used to describe).
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-02, PRs #46 and #47). The list is gone and
  > the files compile once, into the executable, which is the side that
  > linked all along: a linker map of `DarkEden.exe` before and after
  > (989,469 symbol → object rows, 0 differ) is the proof. `_LIB` is
  > `PUBLIC` on the `VS_UI` target: its ~100 `#ifndef _LIB` regions are
  > the standalone UI test harness, some of them class members, so the
  > 72 executable translation units that include VS_UI headers must see
  > the same layout the library's objects do. Unverified, not knowingly
  > broken: on `NOT WIN32` `Client/Client.cpp` stays in `VS_UI` (the
  > non-Windows executable filters out its WinMain).
  - Owner: the linker-map comparison (in PR #46); R4 no longer parses a
    CMake list.

- [x] **4.1 Pure tables first:** `ExperienceTable`, `MItemOptionTable`,
  `MGameStringTable`, `MSoundTable`, `SystemAvailabilities`, `FameInfo`.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-02, PR #44). `gamemodel` exists with the
  > six tables, `ExpInfo`, `MString`, `MStringArray`. Seams cut:
  > `UseEnglishText` takes the `Properties` table (`UseEnglishTextFrom`
  > underneath is the testable core), and
  > `SystemAvailabilitiesManager::LoadFromStream(std::istream&)` takes
  > the lines `GameInit.cpp` reads out of the archive — the shape every
  > later file loader took. Fixed test-first: `ITEMOPTION_TABLE::LoadFromFile`
  > wrote part names past two fixed `MAX_PART` arrays for whatever count
  > the file declared; `ITEMTABLE_INFO`'s constructor left `Price`,
  > `Race`, `DropFrameID` unset. **Known, not fixed:** a refused
  > item-option table leaves the part-name `MString`s NULL and three
  > `VS_UI` call sites `strcpy` them unguarded (pre-existing for any
  > unset part; the alternative was heap corruption at startup).
  > `CToken` also joins unchanged (2026-09-21). `test_token.cpp` links the
  > actual tokenizer and pins token order, remainder ownership and null resets.
  > An ASan test then reproduced `SetString` reading a token after freeing its
  > own buffer. Replacement now copies before releasing the previous string;
  > interior/long tokens, suffixes and empty terminators have lifetime tests.
  - Owner: the membership file, the CMake assertion, the include checker.

- [x] **4.2 Money/price/trade logic:** `MMoneyManager`, `MTradeManager`
  (with `MSortedItemManager`), `MPriceManager`.
  > **Status:** done (PRs #45, #57, #58). The money manager's one reach —
  > the storage-box help hint past 100,000 — is a per-wallet hook the
  > executable installs on the player's wallet (the trade and storage
  > wallets carry none); `operator=` keeps the target's hook. The trade
  > manager's accept delay reads the clock `MItemHost` carries. The price
  > manager goes through **`MPriceHost`** (race, level, stat sums, the
  > potion and gamble half-price events, the shop tax percentage carried
  > unsigned as the server sends it); without a host a price carries no
  > player, event or skill adjustment. Fixed test-first: `CanAddMoney`
  > ignored the balance, so a wallet near the limit said yes and the
  > `AddMoney` after it said no, with the other side's money nowhere to
  > go; `MItem`'s constructor never set `m_bTrade`, the grid position or
  > the durability, so an item arriving during a trade could be deleted
  > by `Trade`; the gamble price's tax multiply overflowed a 32-bit `int`
  > above 21,474,836 (64-bit on both paths now). Executable-side, exempt:
  > `MPetItem` never set its remaining experience or food type.
  > **Known, not fixed:** `CancelTrade` refunds money only — the offered
  > items keep their flag until the next trade start clears it, and a
  > refused refund still answers true; `bMysterious` is a dead parameter
  > `UIMessageManager` still computes; a star price for item type 0 is
  > −20 stars.
  - Owner: the membership file, the CMake assertion, the include checker.

- [x] **4.3 Containers:** `MItemManager`, `MGridItemManager`,
  `MSlotItemManager`, `MQuickSlot`, `MInventory`, `MStorage`, `MShopShelf`.
  > **Status:** done (PRs #54 and #56). The containers' two reaches — the
  > player's affect check on an item and the inventory sound it makes —
  > are `MItemHost::RefreshAffect` and `PlayItemSound`, host-guarded
  > statics on `MItem` so no caller checks for a host; a NULL player is a
  > skipped refresh where the old code would have crashed (recorded).
  > `MCorpse` stays executable-side (it owns an `MCreature`). Fixed
  > test-first: the slot manager wrote the item into its slot before the
  > id map could refuse it, and the grid's `ReplaceItem` removed the
  > occupant and returned true when the map refused the newcomer — in
  > both, the belt/stash/store handlers then `delete`d the refused item,
  > leaving the container holding a freed pointer; and
  > `MShopShelf::NewShelf` indexed its three-entry factory table with the
  > shelf type straight off the wire (`GCShopList`), calling through a
  > code pointer past the table for a value of 3 or more — the factory
  > answers NULL now and both handlers return on it (`SHOP_RACK_SPECIAL`
  > and `SHELF_SPECIAL` are both 1, said at the call).
  - Owner: the membership file, the CMake assertion, the include checker;
    `test_item_containers.cpp`, `test_inventory_storage_shop.cpp`.

- [x] **4.4 Item/skill cores:** `MItemTable`, `MItem`, `MObject`,
  `UserInformation`, `ClientConfig`, `MTimeItemManager`, the gear
  (`MPlayerGear` and the three race gears), `MShop`, `MSkillManager`,
  `MSkillInfoTable`, `SkillDef`.
  > **Status:** done (PRs #48, #53, #59, #60, #61). Everything the task
  > lists is in the library but the halves that are the packet and UI
  > side of items and skills, executable by design: **`MItemUse.cpp`**
  > (every class with a `UseInventory`/`UseQuickItem`/`UseGear` body,
  > moved whole, with the factory table), **`MObjectScreen.cpp`** (the
  > two screen-rectangle members that read draw interpolation state) and
  > **`MSkillAvailable.cpp`** (`SetAvailableSkills`, its vampire
  > counterpart and `CheckMP` — what the player can use *right now* —
  > plus the two war-bonus arrays). **`MItemHost`** carries the animation
  > clock (also the skill-use and trade delays), the top view's item-drop
  > frame pack, `RefreshAffect`, `PlayItemSound`, `RecalculateStatus`,
  > `ResetQuickItemSlot`, `RepairHint` and `EmptyMagazineFor` (the
  > magazine-fitting loop lives in `GameInit`); `GameInit.cpp`'s
  > `InitSkillTree` feeds `LoadFromFileServerDomainInfo` a stream. The
  > `__GAME_CLIENT__` guards in the moved files (always on) went with the
  > includes they wrapped.
  > **Fixed test-first, in the library:** `IsQuestItem` tested the item's
  > own flag only when the timed-item register existed; the requirement
  > getters returned `BYTE` while the slayer ceiling is 295 (a level-150
  > item looked easy to equip); `ITEMOPTION_INFO`, `SKILLINFO_NODE`
  > (`m_SkillStep`, which `AddSkill` branches on) and the item table rows
  > had constructors that left fields unset; `CheckItemStatus` compared an
  > unsigned percentage against `int` thresholds read unchecked from the
  > configuration, so a negative threshold graded every worn piece as
  > almost broken; the zap branch of `AddItem` in all three gears read the
  > wrong slot and accepted a ring-less zap whenever that slot was full;
  > `RemoveItem(GEAR_*)` indexed the slot array with an unbounded id from
  > `GCRemoveFromGear`; `MShop::SetShelf` wrote `m_pShelf[n]` unbounded;
  > `LoadFromFileServerDomainInfo` indexed its eight-row table with an

- [x] **4.5 Rank-bonus table:** `RankBonusTable`, `RankBonusInfo` and
  their enum definitions.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-17, PR #172, `ad86a5aa`).

    three races, row status, lookup bounds, release and table counts).
    The tests fail to link without the extracted constructor and loader.

- [x] **4.6 Map-file loading (code-health follow-up):** the header and five
  scenery record classes, with pure show-time data, are in `gamemodel`.
  > **Status:** implemented 2026-09-18. `MImageObjectScreen.cpp` retains

## Phase 5 — Long tail

- [x] **5.1 Split the debug facilities** so `DebugInfo.h`/`MinTr.h` stop
  gating `packetwire` membership. The task named `SocketAPI.cpp`,
  `DatagramSocket.cpp` and `NPCInfo.cpp`; the real list was
  `tests/arch/packetwire_holdouts.txt`, and the task became "take the
  holdouts in".
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-09, fifth slice; PR #144). **Every `.cpp`
  > under `Client/Packet` is a `packetwire` member**; the holdouts file
  > lists nothing and stays only because W0 reads it and the next
  > holdout needs somewhere to be written down. The last one,
  > `RequestClientPlayerManager.cpp`, went behind nine `WireHost`
  > entries and was deleted four hours later: the review
  > of the move found that the whisper mode it served was compiled out
  > upstream (`0 &&` around every writer of the queue and every
  > whisper-mode `Connect()` - see *A reference on a live line can
  > still be dead*), and reading on from there showed the whole
  > outbound peer side - this client dialling other clients for a
  > profile or a whisper - was dead with it: `GCRequestedIPHandler`
  > began `if (bKorean == false || 1) return;`, so no peer address ever
  > arrived from the server. 5.2's seventh and eighth slices deleted the
  > lot (same PR); what the request-service family keeps in the library
  > is the **inbound** side - `RequestServerPlayer` and its manager,
  > peers dialling this client - and `WireHost` is down to **11
  > entries**, the fourth slice's clock and three file-sender calls
  > among them. The move itself is in the PR's first commit for anyone
  > who needs the seam again. **Kept from the work, both test-first:**
  > `CRWhisper::isSlayer()` compared against `RACE_VAMPIRE`;
  > `CRWhisper::write` checked every length and not the race and now
  > refuses one outside the three before writing a byte (the packet is
  > still received; `test_crwhisper.cpp`). The host installers in
  > `GameInit.cpp` and the tests are **designated initialisers**
  > (C++20); the "checked by reading" caveat the fourth slice recorded
  > is retired.
  > Done before that (PRs #63, #64, #74, #75): the logging facility
  > (`DebugLog.{h,cpp}`) lives in `basic/`, so every library may log and
  > the one object is no longer compiled into two libraries; `DebugInfo.h`
  > is one `#include "MinTr.h"` above two no-op macros and nothing in the

  > inputs (zone id, server number, region flags), and three calls on the
  > peer file-transfer manager (six, and an in-game test, until the

  > tuning accessor answers without a host with the value `ClientConfig`'s own
  > constructor sets, and `WIRE_DEFAULT_*` keeps the executable's
  > fallbacks from drifting. `SendBugReport` is `WireHost.cpp`'s second

- [x] **5.2 Dead/duplicate source removal** (code-health priority 3).

  - Owner: the build (nothing deleted was compiled, so R1 held at each
    step); the wrong-file-edited trap is closed for the files named;
    **R15** for the ninth, tenth and eleventh slices - the nine macros
    as live tokens under `Client/Packet` and outside it, 0 and 0, and
    their definitions in the CMake files, 0.

## Build and review follow-up (2026-09-18)

The scrollbar's position calculations now live in `basic/ScrollRange.h`,
inherited by the real UI widget. The move preserves the existing behavior;
the following fix makes the state private, clamps updates, validates pixel
geometry, and bounds container counts before subtraction and narrowing.
Nine `test_scroll_range.cpp` tests own these contracts, including the
reproduced negative positions and divide-by-zero. Sprite ownership, skin
dimensions, and drawing stay in `VS_UI`.

Source globs now trigger CMake regeneration when files are added or removed.
The optional map viewer follows `BUILD_ENGINE`; the effect viewer no longer
links an unused engine library. Hand-written CMake modules and Makefiles are
visible to Git, while local compilation databases stay ignored. The unused
Emscripten workflow was removed. GNU Make and the effect-viewer helper select
portable job counts and explicit build configurations; README documents their
options. A direct MSBuild target can need a retry after a source-list change if it
loaded the old project before CMake regenerated it.

`basic` and `packetwire` now publish the SDL and Windows wire definitions
their public headers require. Consumers inherit them through target links,
including VS_UI and newly added test sources. The manual list of test files
needing wire macros is gone; a consumer compiled without source-specific
defines guards the contract and reproduced both missing-definition failures.

The timer-manager follow-up keeps only live callbacks, releases deleted
storage, and preserves unique IDs so stale handles cannot target replacements.
Storage is allocated inside `Add`, preserving an allocation-free global
constructor and recoverable allocation failure. Tests cover storage churn,
stale handles, callbacks that delete/replace themselves and ID exhaustion,
alongside the existing monotonic-time tests.

`TArray` now has one implementation in `basic`, with compatibility headers
in SpriteLib and framelib. Its existing tests exercise all include paths.
The unused `CDataTable` raw-object serializer is deleted, and 43 top-level
client includes now name the actual relative path to `Platform.h`.

The unused GL import and TGA/IMG interfaces are deleted, together with their
abandoned UI drawing comments. VS_UI uses the existing SDL surface helper;
it no longer imports declarations from the missing legacy graphics DLL.

MSVC compiles every C/C++ target with UTF-8 source and execution encoding.
The source-encoding CTest checks the repository's C/C++ files, and the unit
suite compares narrow literals from BOM and non-BOM sources with explicit
UTF-8 bytes. Existing UTF-8 BOMs are supported; they do not change literal bytes.

`ui_tests` links the real VS_UI library for independently reachable components.
Button tests cover default state, callback dispatch and event-button image
selection. The Windows feedback pointer lives with its existing CImm adapter,
so these tests link that adapter without the game UI loop or fake globals.

The same UI target tests SkinManager through its actual CRarFile reader.
Header tokens use owned strings, coordinate rows are checked before insertion,
and rejected reloads preserve the last valid skin.

The code-health review also records 18 previously completed fixes that still
had open headings, with their current source/test evidence. These status
corrections do not claim new runtime reproductions. Live-server verification
remains optional and is not a merge or completion requirement.

## First candidate (decided 2026-09-01)

**Task 1.1: the `packetwire` library.** Chosen over the alternatives
because:

1. **Zero-edit move.** Every member file's includes were scanned; none
   reached game code, so the move commit was pure CMake — the safest
   possible first step for agents to execute and review.
2. **It sits under the #1 open risk.** The info classes *are* the parsers
   the GC packets delegate server-supplied data to; the streams are where
   every length check ultimately lands. Tests aimed there have the highest
   defect yield per hour — and the first known defect was already queued
   (task 1.3, the `StringStream` float/double stack overflow, already
   proven real on the server's identical copy).
3. **It unblocks Phase 2.** The dispatcher, and eventually all 700+ packet
   classes, land in this target; creating it first meant every later phase
   was "grow the membership list", not "invent a target".

Runner-up considered and deferred: extracting `ExperienceTable`-class pure
tables (4.1) — testable, but it neither touched the top risk nor unblocked
anything else.
