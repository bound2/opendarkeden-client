# Client Restructuring Plan

**Original plan complete as of 2026-09-09.** Its tasks are `done` and have their owners;
PRs #144 and #145 carry the last slices. What the plan leaves behind is the
machinery, not a to-do list: the membership files, the include checker, the
ratchets and the fix policy (task 3.1) are what keep the end state
true from here, and *What the review rounds settled* is what a later slice
of any kind should read first. 5.2's *Candidates for a next slice* - dead
code the plan found and did not take unasked - was the last list open and
closed on 2026-09-16 with the eleventh slice; what still shrinks is the
exemption list, whenever a task extracts a seam. Phase 4 records the completed
game-model extractions, including the rank-bonus table. The follow-up is reconciled in
[the completion evidence](code-health-reconciliation-2026-09-23.md), with current
regression owners and explicit asset/runtime limits.

Living, trackable plan for moving the OpenDarkEden client's game code out of the
`DarkEden` executable and into testable static libraries, while the outstanding
findings of `docs/code-health-review-2026-08-29.md` keep getting fixed. The end
state: **a fix that touches library code ships with a unit test in the same
commit; code that cannot be tested is a shrinking, named exception rather than
the default.**

This mirrors the server repo's `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` (same parent directory,
`../server`), which has already executed the exact refactoring this client
needs on its half of the shared codebase: `execute()` stripped off the packet
classes, a dispatch table at the composition root, the whole wire layer
compiled once into a standalone `de-kernel` library, membership held by a file
and enforced by an include-graph checker, and legacy debt tracked by
shrink-only ratchets. Where a task here has a proven server twin, the task
cites it — read the server's status notes before starting, because its
adversarial reviews recorded the traps.

## How to use this document

- Every task has a checkbox and a `> **Status:**` line. Update the status line
  **in the same commit** as the work it describes. Allowed values:
  `not started` | `in progress (<what remains>)` | `done (<commit>)` |
  `dropped (<why>)`.
- A status line records the **current** state and what the next reader
  needs to act: the owner, the conventions the reviews settled, the open
  bugs, what remains. The per-change narrative — what moved, what the
  review round found, the test list, the suite count, the ratchet delta —
  belongs in the PR description and the commit message, not here. PRs #33
  through #77, then #142 to #145, and their commits hold that history for
  everything below.
- A task is only `done` when its **Owner** exists — the test or mechanism that
  keeps the rule true from then on. Landing the change without the owner is
  `in progress (owner missing)`.
- Ratchet numbers only go **down**. Re-measure with the given command before
  and after a change that claims progress; commit the updated number with the
  change. A recorded growth (a split that adds an executable translation
  unit) moves the baseline with the reason written beside it.
- Substantial tasks get an **adversarial review** before merge (two
  reviewers; standing practice in this repo — every round so far has found
  real defects in the change itself).
- Verification for every extraction: both Debug trees build
  (`build/vs2022` with /RTC1, `build/vs2022-asan` with ASan), the test suite
  is green in a plain tree **and** an ASan tree, `wire_inventory_fresh`
  passes, and the applicable CI checks pass. **Live-server verification is
  optional, not a merge or completion gate** (user instruction, 2026-09-17).
  Do not wait for a runtime report or request one as approval to merge.
  Do not launch `DarkEden.exe` yourself unless the user asks.

### Working agreements for refactoring agents

- **New library targets use explicit source lists, never `file(GLOB)`.** The
  existing globs don't use `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`, so a moved file silently stays
  in the old target until someone reconfigures; explicit lists make membership
  reviewable and are what the ratchet script parses. After moving files,
  reconfigure both trees.
- **Moving a file between targets must not change its bytes** in the same
  commit when it has no seam to cut. Move first, prove the build, then fix —
  separate commits, so the diff that changes behavior is readable. A file
  that only links once its reaches go through a host moves and cuts in one
  commit (the Phase 4 pattern), and that commit names every change that is
  not the move.
- Sources are CRLF; use the Edit tool, not `sed -i`/`awk`, to modify them.
- Wire layout is pinned: any change under `Client/Packet` that touches
  `read()`/`write()`/`getPacketMaxSize()` must keep
  `tests/wire-layout.txt` in sync (regenerate via
  `tests/tools/gen_wire_inventory.pl`, re-record with `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1`) and
  must be diffed against the server with
  `server/tests/tools/wire_inventory_diff.sh`. A layout change is a protocol
  change and needs the identical change in the server repo.

### What the review rounds settled

Each of these cost at least one review finding; they are the rules the
per-task status lines no longer restate.

- **Measure the value, not the spelling.** A checker that matches
  `array[pPacket->getSlotID()]` misses the hundred sites that copy the
  value into a local first; one that hardcodes a receiver name misses the
  handlers that call it something else. `check_packet_indices.pl` walks
  the value; R7 and R8 exist as a pair because R7 counts a spelling.
- **A ratchet at zero is a claim about the ratchet.** R7 reached 0 and was
  read as finding C19 closed while 24 live sites used an entry copied into
  a static array first. Anything stronger than "the pattern sees nothing"
  needs a different instrument, and a new instrument gets the same
  adversarial reading as the code — it will not get it from the person who
  just built it (R8 was recorded at 13, and the population was 43).
- **A checker pins its own denominator.** `check_format_arity.pl` passed
  three times while checking nothing (a Perl list assignment, `find(1)`
  under PowerShell, a `//` inside a string literal). Both the sites it
  finds and the sites it resolves are floors now; every way a scan can
  shrink must fail rather than report a smaller number and exit 0.
- **A search that finds nothing is a fact about the search.** A grep that
  excludes the name it is searching for (`grep RenderText | grep -v
  TextService`, when every call is `TextService::RenderText`); a per-file
  grep over CP949 sources, which grep classifies as binary and stops
  reading silently; a grep for `#define __USE_ENCRYPTER__` that missed the
  define in `Encrypter.h` while the golden tests already said the branch
  was live. Read what the tests say before declaring code dead.
- **A link proof takes the address of non-virtual members.** A pointer to
  a virtual member is a vtable index and need not reference the defining
  object, so such a proof links cleanly with the file removed from the
  library. Verify a link proof by taking the file back out.
- **Scripted rewrites bound their patterns and are followed by a comment
  sweep.** A non-greedy `.*?` under `/s` swallowed 87 lines of `GameUI.cpp`
  into one argument; the ratchets could not have caught it, because a
  corrupted file has the right number of sites. After a scripted removal,
  sweep for orphaned banners and `//#include` lines.
- **Uninitialised members are reproduced, not guarded.** `/RTC1` fills
  stack locals with `0xCC` and the CRT fills heap with `0xCD`, so a test
  that reads a fresh object fails deterministically; but neither `/RTC1`
  nor ASan flags an uninitialised *member*, so the test reads the fill
  pattern rather than waiting for a crash. Every `gamemodel` slice found
  at least one constructor that set every field but a few.
- **A host entry answers without a host with the value a missing config
  would give, never zero.** A test binary, or a host whose entries are
  NULL, gets the `ClientConfig` constructor's defaults; a missing clock
  means no delay; a missing player means a skipped refresh rather than a
  crash — recorded as a behaviour delta where the old code dereferenced
  unguarded. Host readers are private statics on the class (`MItem::Clock()`),
  guard the function pointer, and are re-read on every call, never cached.
- **A host installer is designated-initialised.** When `WireHost` reached
  24 entries, fourteen shared a signature with another, and the
  executable that installs them is never linked into a test, so a
  positional slip compiled and passed the whole suite; the fourth slice
  recorded the order as "checked by reading". C++20 designators make an
  entry in the wrong slot, or one that does not exist, a compile error.
  What they cannot check is the body an entry points at.
- **A reference on a live line can still be dead.** The whisper seam was
  described as live behaviour because the code that reaches it is
  compiled; every path *to* that code sits behind `0 &&`. Before
  describing what a seam does, find the caller that runs.
- **A class split across a library and the executable** costs nothing when
  the class has no virtuals (`MSkillSet`, `TextService`) or when the
  library constructs none of the split classes (`MBomb`, `MHolyWater`), and
  is otherwise a vtable referencing symbols a test binary cannot link, so
  the class moves whole.
- **Every fix commit names its `Test path:`** (`lib + test`, `moved, then
  fixed`, `exempt`); a fix that could not be reproduced is a *regression
  guard* in its message, not a reproduction. `tools/git-hooks/commit-msg`
  refuses a `fix:` without one.
- **Two ratchets on the same finding see different things.** R3 counts
  `sprintf` lines but `\b` rejects the `w` in `wsprintf`; R7 counts both.
  R4 greps `g_p*` and cannot see a library file calling an executable-side
  *function* (which is what the link proofs are for) or a global under
  another name (`g_Mode`). Read each ratchet's comment for what it cannot
  see before quoting its number.

## Goals / non-goals

**Goals**

1. **Every new fix is unit-tested.** The code a fix touches gets moved into
   (or already lives in) a static library linked by `unit_tests`, and the fix
   is written test-first. Exceptions are named in the exemption list below,
   not decided ad hoc.
2. **The wire layer becomes a standalone library** (`packetwire`): streams,
   encrypter, info classes, and eventually all packet classes — so the #1
   open risk (unvalidated server input in `Client/Packet/Gpackets/`,
   code-health review priority 1) becomes directly testable with hostile
   inputs instead of only greppable.
3. **Game-model logic leaves the executable** piecewise (tables, inventories,
   price/trade logic), cutting `g_p*` global seams as it goes.
4. Architecture rules owned by tests (membership files, include-graph
   checker, ratchets), never by memory.

**Non-goals**

- No behavior change on the wire or in game rules unless a task says so
  explicitly. Layout stays pinned by the wire inventory + the server diff.
- No rewrite of the render/game loop (`GameMain.cpp`, `MZone` drawing,
  `GameUI.cpp`) or the VS_UI widget tree. These stay executable-or-UI-side
  and are covered by builds and available regression checks; runtime
  verification is optional.
- No new test framework. `tests/framework/test_framework.h` stays; tests are
  files in `tests/unit/` (globbed — reconfigure after adding one).
- Not a port of the server's kernel wholesale: the two repos stay separate
  codebases pinned to one wire contract by the shared inventory, and to one
  rule implementation by the vendored de-core subset (task 4.12).

## Exemption list (tangled, outside the unit-test libraries)

Code on this list is fixed executable-side with build verification, available
automated checks and a **regression guard** note in the commit message when
the defect was not reproduced. Live-server verification is optional.
Shrink it when a task extracts a seam, and record the removal here.

| Code | Why exempt |
|---|---|
| `GameMain.cpp`, `GameInit.cpp`, `GameUI.cpp`, `Client.cpp`, `SDLMain.cpp` | process lifecycle, DLL whitelist, render loop and quest UI events; also where the hosts (`MItemHost`, `MPriceHost`, `WireHost`) are installed, which no test can prove - `WireHost`'s installer is designated-initialised since 2026-09-09, so a wrong slot there is a compile error, but a wrong *body* still is not |
| `MZone` live sector allocation/application, rendering and visual-effect ownership / `TileRenderer` draw paths | map parsing is tested in `ZoneMapData`; application and effects reach live sectors, creature status, sprite tables and `MTopView`; drawing uses live surfaces. Viewer tools cover some drawing; ownership guards use full builds and source-path audits. |
| `MTopView` draw calls and the per-frame state that only the draw calls read (`DrawItemBroken` and the other draw branches) | the view draws on the live surface and reads the frame clock (`g_CurrentFrame`, `g_bFrameChanged`), `g_pEventManager` and the player's gear globals; it is the render loop the goals keep executable-side. Rules that can be stated without those globals move into a library first and get a test. Fade direction, stepping, delay and stopping now belong to `gamemodel`'s `MScreenFade` (task 4.18), with the 31 to -1 transition tested under both char signednesses; `MTopView` keeps suppression, colour conversion and surface calls. Fixes to the draw calls use full builds; the MinGW and Emscripten compiles some fix commits cite are a local check that is not in the tree, and no CI job repeats them. |
| `MGuildMarkManager::LoadGuildMark` integration | binds the live guild mapper to the renderer's owned sprite cache; index and sprite decoding stay in the tested SpriteLib helpers. Publication and negative-cache guards use full builds and source/ownership review. |
| `MCreature`, `MPlayer`, `MFakeCreature` movement and attached-effect orchestration; `PacketFunction::ExecuteActionInfoFromMainNode` | virtual character classes reach the live zone, UI, sprite tables and effect generators; action results transfer to `MEffectTarget` and execute through the same game objects. Bounds/queue/ownership guards stay here; extracting those classes would require the render/game-loop rewrite excluded above. Review regression guards use full builds and existing automated checks, without a runtime gate. |
| `VS_UI/src/**` rendering and dialogs that still reach game globals | these paths use full builds and available automated checks; live verification is optional. `ui_tests` now links the real Button, EventButton, SkinManager, LineEditor, LineEditorVisual state/focus methods, InputFocusManager and the UI result receiver, so those independently reachable components require test-first fixes. `LineEditorVisual::Show` remains separate because it reaches the game's renderer. |
| `Client/PacketHandler/*Handler.cpp` bodies, except the handlers `tests/arch/gamemodel_files.txt` lists | mutate `g_pZone`/creature state; the *parsers* they consume are in `packetwire` and testable, the mutations are not. The reason does not hold for a handler whose body reaches only model state: such a handler compiles in `gamemodel`, a test runs it on a real packet, and a fix to it is test-first (lib + test). Amended 2026-09-30 (task 4.15), when eight handlers moved in: the four phone-slot handlers (`g_pUserInformation`), the trade money and offer handlers (`g_pTradeManager`, `g_pMoneyManager`), `GCSystemAvailabilities` (`g_pSystemAvailableManager`) and `GCMonsterKillQuestInfo` (`g_pQuestInfoManager`, `g_pCreatureTable`). The row is keyed to the membership file so that a later handler move needs no further edit here. The rest of `Client/` is presumed movable until a task proves otherwise, and code has left this list by moving before: `RequestClientPlayerManager.cpp` from the connect-paths row (task 5.1). The login world/server list rebuilds and their complete handlers now run in `gamemodel` (tasks 4.19 and 4.84); designated hosts retain UI refreshes and mode transitions in the executable. |
| `UIMessageManager::Execute_UI_CHAT_RETURN` | application chat callback reaches the current game mode, player, party/guild state, live socket, help events and dialogs. Its payload borrowing is source-audited with full builds; the queue that owns deferred text is independently tested in `ui_tests`. |
| `Client/MinTr.h` raw trace transport | the one remaining caller sends a fixed text message to the optional external Win32 trace window. Unused variadic and command formatting paths are retired. |
| `PacketFunction.cpp` connect paths | Winsock + connection state machine. `RequestClientPlayerManager.cpp` was listed here until 2026-09-09; task 5.1's fifth slice put its seams behind `WireHost`, and task 5.2's eighth slice deleted it with the rest of the outbound peer side |
| The executable halves of split classes: `MItemUse.cpp`, `MObjectScreen.cpp`, `MSkillAvailable.cpp`, `TextServiceScreen.cpp` | the packet/dialog/drawing side of a class whose core is in a library, by design |
| `ModifyStatusManager.cpp` `Function_MODIFY_*` bodies | the player's reactions to a status change: each reaches `g_pPlayer`, the UI setters, the gear and inventory, `g_pGameMessage` or `g_pSkillAvailable`, and runs from `MPlayer::SetStatus`. The rules they apply are in libraries and tested there (a vampire's skill cost is `MSkillInfoTable::GetVampireConsumeMP` in `gamemodel`); the reactions use full builds and a regression guard. Added 2026-09-29 with the call that recomputes a vampire's skills on an INT change. |
| `Client/UIDialog.cpp` dialog popups (`PopupPCTalkDlg` and its siblings) | each builds a VS_UI dialog from `g_pCreatureTable`, `g_pPCTalkBox` and `gC_vs_ui`, so a fix has no logic left to move into a library and no harness to run in. Regression guards use full builds and a read of the function. Added 2026-09-29 for `7d16c726`. |
| `PacketFunction.cpp` error popups and addon item tables (`PopupErrorMessage`, `InitPacketItemTable`) | the popups reach the live UI and message tables, and the tables store item templates the executable builds at start-up (`g_pPacketItemShoulder` and its siblings); neither has a harness. Precedent `0557a039`; also `10b1da62` and `6ebdc97c`. Added 2026-09-29. The connect paths in the row above are a separate case. |
| `UIMessageManager.cpp` handlers other than `Execute_UI_CHAT_RETURN` (the other `Execute_UI_*` bodies) | each reaches the live storages, inventory, `g_pTempInformation`, the player and the socket, like the chat handler above; the class has no harness. Precedent `ace28baf`; also `dfaeda5b`. Added 2026-09-29. |
| `MEventManager.cpp` background-image loading and live host adapter | owns the `CDirectDrawSurface` cache and supplies rendering/player callbacks. Event records, flag queries and expiry are inherited from `gamemodel`'s `MEventQueue` and require unit tests (task 4.17); only the image loader and callback bodies remain executable-side. |
| `DebugKit.cpp` (`CDebugKit`) | a debug facility compiled into the executable and reached only under `DEBUG_INFO`, which no build defines; moving it into `gamemodel` would change the W2/M2 include rules. Precedent `6a46b721`. Added 2026-09-29. |
| `tools/viewers/**` | developer tools outside the libraries and the game: a fix is checked by building the viewer and, where it has one, running its self-test (`d1c3d719`, `d54f7fed`). Added 2026-09-29. |

`UserOption` persistence is compiled once in `VS_UI/src/UserOption.cpp`.
`user_option_tests` links that library object and exercises the real settings
reader/writer together with `KeyAccelerator`; persistence fixes are test-first.

`SlayerPortalData` parses the portal resource independently of the dialog.
`test_portal_data.cpp` links the production reader and covers truncation, field
and count bounds, little-endian unaligned input and atomic replacement. The
dialog's sprite coordinates, zone filtering and navigation remain UI exemptions.

Everything else under `Client/*.cpp` and `Client/Packet/**` is presumed
movable until a task proves otherwise and adds it here with a reason.

## Ratchets (shrink-only)

Compiler warnings also have a shared target policy and a clean-build budget
checker in `tools/ci/check-warnings.pl` ([operation](../tools/ci/warnings.md)).
The generated target-option inventory and parser fixtures own the mechanism;
measured budgets cover all ten CI preset/architecture combinations. Every
increase fails, and a decrease requires tightening the committed budget.

`tests/ratchet/ratchets.sh` (ctest `ratchets`) holds the baselines inline
and fails the suite when a count **rises** or drops unrecorded, so
tightening lands in the same commit as the progress. Measurements are
grep-only by design; nothing is generated or overwritten. The script's
comment on each ratchet says what it cannot see and keeps the history of
every baseline move; the table below is the current reading.

| # | Metric | Now | What it counts, and does not |
|---|--------|---:|---|
| R1 | Application translation units compiled directly into the `DarkEden` target | **346** | `ClCompile` entries in `DarkEden.vcxproj`, excluding CMake's generated `CMakeFiles/DarkEden.dir/cmake_pch.cxx`, read from the ctest run's own build dir; SKIP (never PASS) without a supported generated project. Both the Visual Studio configure stamp and Ninja's `build.ninja` must be newer than CMakeLists.txt and both library membership files. Ninja's baseline is **344**, since the non-Windows source list is two files shorter; Linux/macOS CI verifies that count. Baseline 1,044 on 2026-09-01; 484 after task 5.2's eighth slice. **482 on 2026-09-17:** the earlier deletion of `md5.cpp` had left the recorded 484 one too high (483 measured before this extraction); task 4.5 moves `RankBonusTable.cpp` into `gamemodel` (483 → 482). **478 later that day:** delete the four unused Direct3D texture/shadow cache translation units; their object declarations were commented out and the active sprite path never constructed them. **477 later still:** remove the unused Windows-only WinINet downloader; Ninja remains 475. It counts what still cannot be unit-tested. Recorded growths, each the executable side of a split: `PacketHandlerRegistry.cpp`, `GCExchangeBuyHandler.cpp`, `MItemUse.cpp`, `MObjectScreen.cpp`, `MSkillAvailable.cpp`, `TextServiceScreen.cpp`. **473 Windows / 471 Ninja later that day:** six map-record/header translation units move to `gamemodel`, while two new executable files retain screen geometry and live interaction actions; `ShowTimeChecker`'s pure constructor and I/O move to `ShowTimeData.cpp`. A further executable unit moved to `basic` with `CMessageArray` (2026-09-18). **470 Windows / 468 Ninja on 2026-09-21:** `UserOption.cpp` moves unchanged into `VS_UI`; its test links the same object as the game. **469 Windows / 467 Ninja:** the corrected `SXml.cpp` moves unchanged into `VS_UI`, replacing the older duplicate and allowing XML tests to link the production implementation. **468 Windows / 466 Ninja:** the help-message loader moves unchanged into `VS_UI` for real-library parser tests. **467 on 2026-09-21:** `CToken.cpp` joins `gamemodel` byte-identically so token and reset lifetimes can be tested. **466 Windows / 464 Ninja:** the empty handwritten `Client_PCH.cpp` is retired when CMake starts producing the private PCH. Generated PCH producers are excluded from both inventories; ordinary application `.cxx` and `.cc` files remain counted.  **465 Windows / 463 Ninja on 2026-09-24:** the inactive Client/DebugInfo.cpp implementation is removed.  **460 Windows / 458 Ninja on 2026-09-24:** five unchanged world metadata implementations join gamemodel. **456 Windows / 454 Ninja:** quest metadata joins gamemodel; profile and shrine file adapters join VS_UI. **455 Windows / 453 Ninja:** party membership joins gamemodel behind its live-creature host. **456 Windows / 454 Ninja:** the generated English NPC name table (`MNPCTableEnglish.cpp`) is a recorded growth; it writes an executable global. **454 Windows / 452 Ninja on 2026-09-28:** the NPC talk boxes (`TalkBox.cpp`, `MStringList.cpp`) join gamemodel so the menu-answer mapping can be tested. **453 Windows / 451 Ninja later that day:** `MStatusManager.cpp` joins gamemodel so the character-select stat preview can be tested (task 4.12, slice 3). **449 Windows / 447 Ninja on 2026-09-29:** the action and effect tables (`MActionInfoTable.cpp`, `MEffectSpriteTypeTable.cpp`, `MEffectStatusTable.cpp`, `MCreatureSpriteTable.cpp`) join gamemodel so their loaders can be tested (task 4.1); the move changed no loader, and later commits fixed the loaders test-first. **447 Windows / 445 Ninja on 2026-09-29:** the chat filter (`MStringMap.cpp`, `MChatManager.cpp`) joins gamemodel, its one option read behind `MChatHost`, so the curse filter can be tested (task 4.13). **445 Windows / 443 Ninja on 2026-09-29, after merging both:** the creature status array (`MStatus.cpp`) and the request/answer mode register (`TempInformation.cpp`) join gamemodel unchanged so they can be tested (task 4.14); each branch removed two from 449/447, and the merged tree was measured, not added up. (The merge had left this entry's bold marker doubled and its first clause repeated; tidied 2026-09-30.) **437 Windows / 435 Ninja on 2026-09-30:** the eight packet handlers that reach only model state (`GCPhoneConnectedHandler.cpp`, `GCPhoneDisconnectedHandler.cpp`, `GCPhoneSayHandler.cpp`, `GCRingHandler.cpp`, `GCTradeMoneyHandler.cpp`, `GCTradeRemoveItemHandler.cpp`, `GCSystemAvailabilitiesHandler.cpp`, `GCMonsterKillQuestInfoHandler.cpp`) join gamemodel from `Client/PacketHandler` so a test can run them on real packets (task 4.15). **436 Windows / 434 Ninja on 2026-10-02:** `CServerInformation.cpp` joins `gamemodel` unchanged so login world/server selection can be tested (task 4.19). **434 Windows / 432 Ninja later that day:** `MFunctionManager.cpp` and `MRequestMode.cpp` join `gamemodel` unchanged so callback dispatch and player/view request state can be tested (task 4.20). **433 Windows / 431 Ninja later that day:** `MathTable.cpp` joins `gamemodel` unchanged so effect trigonometry and steering can be tested (task 4.21). **432 Windows / 430 Ninja later that day:** `ServerInfoFileParser.cpp` joins `gamemodel` after removing its unused `MinTr.h` include, so dimension-specific login and reconnect configuration can be tested (task 4.22). **431 Windows / 429 Ninja later that day:** `MWeather.cpp` joins `gamemodel` behind player-origin and viewport callbacks (task 4.23). **428 Windows / 426 Ninja later that day:** `MJusticeAttackManager.cpp` and its add/remove packet handlers join `gamemodel` after dropping unobserved timestamps (task 4.25). **427 Windows / 425 Ninja later that day:** `PCConfigTable.cpp` joins `gamemodel` unchanged so saved character slots and per-world account settings can be tested (task 4.26). **425 Windows / 423 Ninja later that day:** `MonsterNameTable.cpp` and `MLevelNameTable.cpp` join `gamemodel` unchanged, with the title/hallucination selection state extracted from `MCreature` (task 4.27). **424 Windows / 422 Ninja later that day:** `MWarManager.cpp` joins `gamemodel` with live zone and UI actions behind `MWarHost` (task 4.28). **423 Windows / 421 Ninja later that day:** `MShopTemplate.cpp` joins `gamemodel` unchanged, with the NPC shelf-building rules extracted behind `NPCShopHost` (task 4.29). **421 Windows / 419 Ninja later that day:** NPC dialogue (`MNPCScriptTable.cpp`) and its English overlay join `gamemodel` unchanged after a separate unused-include cleanup (task 4.30). **420 Windows / 418 Ninja later that day:** effect-target state (`MEffectTarget.cpp`) joins `gamemodel` behind its player-roster removal host, alongside the extracted deferred-result queue (task 4.31). **419 later still:** portal records join `gamemodel` (task 4.32;

| R2 | Packet `.cpp` files still defining a packet-style `::execute(Player` | **0** | `grep -rlE '^void\s+\w+::execute\s*\(\s*Player' Client/Packet/{Gpackets,Cpackets,Lpackets,Rpackets,Upackets} --include='*.cpp' \| grep -v Handler \| wc -l`. Baseline 448. Holds the line since `Packet::execute` itself was deleted; the client twin of the server's R4. |
| R3 | Live `sprintf`/`strcpy`/`strcat` lines under `Client/Packet` and `Client/PacketHandler` | **0** | Line-based; strips `//` tails before matching, so a commented-out call does not count. `\b` rejects the `w` in `wsprintf`, which R7 sees instead. Baseline 61 (a quarter of it commented-out code). Holds the line since the packet-tree copy pass (2026-09-04, PR #76). |
| R4 | Library-compiled `.cpp` files referencing `g_p*` client globals no library file defines | **0** | Over the library dirs (minus CMake-excluded files) plus the `packetwire` and `gamemodel` membership files; comment lines excluded; the subtraction is library-wide, so a library file reading a global another library defines is not a seam. Blind to a library file calling an executable-side *function* (the link proofs cover that) and to a global not named `g_p*`. Baseline 83. **20 on 2026-09-18:** the editor uses the common TextService-backed printer, removing its direct `g_pLast`/`g_pBack` declarations. The printer still reaches game state; this is a reduction in direct references, not a claim that rendering is independent. **10 on 2026-09-21:** moving `UserOption` and `g_pUserOption` into `VS_UI` makes ten existing UI files resolve their only executable-owned global within the library; an ownership reclassification, not ten further file extractions. The text-mode scan now includes the NUL-bearing `VS_UI_GameCommon.cpp` on every platform: **11** is the corrected count; GNU grep previously omitted that file while BSD grep counted it.  **10 on 2026-09-24:** the duplicate inactive VS_UI/DebugInfo.cpp implementation is removed.  **5 on 2026-09-24:** zone, creature, NPC and guild metadata plus the game calendar belong to gamemodel, with real object/link tests; their implementation bytes are unchanged. **4 later that day:** CImm's unused sound-manager declaration is removed. **0 later that day:** party ownership and eight UI host callbacks remove the remaining live references; an inline comment naming the player global is translated without changing the scanner. This is not a claim that every UI object links independently. |
| R5 | Direct packet `execute()` call sites outside `Client/Packet` | **0** | The unused, commented-out `PacketAttackMelee` block in `CGameUpdate.cpp` was deleted on 2026-09-24. Added when the 2.2 review found the client fabricates packets locally and calls `execute()` on them; a live caller is a compile error now, before it is a ratchet failure. |
| R6 | *retired* — `packetwire` members calling `SendBugReport` | — | Lived one slice (2026-09-03). Added to replace the failed-link detector that stubbing the symbol had disabled; fired on the next promotion (count 2), which said "move the function, not the seam". `SendBugReport` is in `Client/Packet/WireHost.cpp`, the stub is gone, and the link is the detector again — narrower, since a link catches a call only in a library `unit_tests` links and in an object a test pulls in, which is what the address-taking link proofs in `test_wire_host.cpp` and `test_player_base.cpp` guarantee. |
| R7 | Call sites handing a game string table entry to a printf as its **format**, where the lookup is spelled at the call site | **0** | Five alternatives: the `sprintf` family (`fprintf` included), the size-taking family, `AddFormat`, the offset-append form `sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), …)`, and `.Format` (`MString::Format` is a printf reached as a method). The tree is joined before matching because sites put destination and format on different lines. **Blind to indirection**: an entry copied into a static array or a local first is invisible. Baseline 293; holds the line since PR #71. On its own it is not a measure of finding C19. |
| R8 | printf-family calls whose **format argument is not a string literal**, across `Client`, `VS_UI` and `basic`, headers included | **0** | The population R7 measures a spelling of; it cannot tell a table entry from a legitimate forward, so renaming cannot satisfy it. The 40 were read: 27 vararg forwarders, 6 inside `SafeFormat`'s `Emit`, 2 literals behind `TEXT()`/`_T()`, 5 declarations. The family list was enumerated from the tree (`fprintf`, `vswprintf` included). Cannot see a destination containing parentheses; those 16 sites were audited by hand, all literal formats. Added 2026-09-04 (PR #73).  **34 on 2026-09-24:** SafeFormat uses literal CRT conversions and bounded field padding; its six computed format calls are gone.  **0 on 2026-09-24:** live diagnostic and message entry points carry tagged arguments into SafeFormat; inactive debug formatters are retired and two macro-wrapped UI literals are bounded. The scanner and its scope are unchanged. |
| R9 | Dynamic exception specifications (`throw()`, `throw(X, Y)`) under `basic/` | **0** | Not a removal: the first conformance slice went looking and found `basic/` had never carried one. The parentheses must hold type names or nothing, which is what tells a specification from a `throw` statement - the six live `throw ("...")` statements in the shop packets do not count, and neither does `throw Error(...)`. Blind to a type list it cannot spell (a template argument, a pointer, a comment between the parens), to a specification inside a `/* */` block, and to one behind a macro. The file list is asserted non-empty, so a renamed `basic/` fails instead of measuring 0 of nothing. Added 2026-09-06. |
| R10 | The same, across the library set: `basic`, `Client/SpriteLib`, `Client/TextSystem`, `Client/DXLib`, `Client/framelib` and `VS_UI` as whole trees, the `gamemodel` membership file, the `packetwire` membership file **and every `.h` under `Client/Packet`** | **0** | All of it is the packet tree - every other library is already at 0. 2,211 in the membership file's `.cpp` and 9,252 in the headers, over 1,042 of the set's 1,473 files; 8,528 empty `throw()` and 2,971 type lists. The headers are in the set because a specification is part of the function type, so a `.cpp`-only metric would have counted half of every edit as progress. Files are joined before matching: five specifications in `SocketAPI.cpp` span two lines, and line-based this set reads 11,494. Outside it, and the rest of the workload: `Client/PacketHandler` (284), the remaining executable sources (49) and `tests/` (9). Added 2026-09-06. **9,664 on 2026-09-07:** the 162 files directly under `Client/Packet` are at 0 - 143 carried a specification - and so is `tests/` (1,799 + 9 sites: the wire core, the packet framework and players, the info classes); ten destructors that carried a type list are spelled `noexcept(false)`, which the pattern does not count, and the remainder is the packet directories. **9,055 on 2026-09-07:** Lpackets, Upackets and Rpackets at 0 as well (609 sites, by script), leaving Cpackets and Gpackets. **5,883 on 2026-09-07:** Cpackets at 0 (3,172 sites, by script; the one packet that derives from another keeps its base unspecified), leaving Gpackets. **0 on 2026-09-07:** Gpackets at 0 (5,883 sites, by script; two packets deriving from GCChangeInventoryItemNum keep its getPacketSize unspecified). The library set is clean; what R10 never covered - `Client/PacketHandler` (284) and the executable sources (34) - is the next slice, with a ratchet of its own. |
| R11 | `register` storage-class specifiers in every `.cpp`, `.h` and `.inl` under `Client`, `VS_UI`, `basic`, `tools`, `third_party` and `tests` | **0** | Closed finding 4 of the assessment: 627 in 23 files removed 2026-09-07, all mechanical. Counted by `tests/tools/count_register.pl`, a tokenizer that strips comments and string literals per file, because the R9/R10 pipeline strips `/* */` before `//` and reads the blitters' `//*pDest = ...` line comments as block-comment openers (over the 23 files on master it saw 538 of the 627, a figure that moves with file order) and would count the NPC script strings that say "register as a couple". The `.c` files stay outside: they compile as C, where the keyword is valid. Added 2026-09-07. |
| R12 | Dynamic exception specifications anywhere: every `.h`, `.cpp` and `.inl` under `Client`, `VS_UI`, `basic`, `tools`, `third_party` and `tests` | **0** | R9 and R10 cover the libraries; this holds the executable side too, with the same pattern and blind spots. The last 319 outside the library set - 284 in `Client/PacketHandler` (one per handler `execute` definition), 32 in the two request-side packet factory managers, three in `RequestFileManager` and `Updater/UpdateManager.h` - went 2026-09-07, all type lists or `throw()` deleted, none promoted. Finding 3 of the assessment is closed on the source side. Added 2026-09-07. |
| R13 | Platform macros spelled outside `basic/Platform.h`: `__LINUX__`/`_LINUX` anywhere in the C++ tree, `PLATFORM_MACOS` outside `basic/`, and `PLATFORM_MACOS` in any CMake file | **0** | The port's build-contract slice (`docs/linux-macos-port-assessment-2026-09-07.md`, area A). Before it, four spellings of Linux coexisted and the build defined none - `__LINUX__` at 63 sites, so the socket and file APIs compiled neither their Windows nor their POSIX branch off Windows - while CMake handed every non-Windows target `PLATFORM_MACOS` in six places. `Platform.h` now detects the platform alone and adds `PLATFORM_POSIX`; the POSIX branches test that, and CMake passes no platform macro off Windows. `basic/` is exempt from the macOS count because `PlatformSDL.cpp`'s mach-o code is genuinely Darwin-only. The one counted use is the macOS font list in `TextBackendSDL.cpp`, a real Darwin branch; a second is a deliberate baseline change. Blind to the compiler builtins (`_WIN32`, `__APPLE__`, `__linux__`). Counted by `tests/tools/count_identifier.pl`, the register tokenizer generalised. Added 2026-09-08.  **0 on 2026-09-24:** the unchanged ordered font fallback list moves into `basic/PlatformSDL.cpp`; TextSystem consumes the platform API. |
| R14 | Live `GetTickCount()`/`timeGetTime()` calls under `Client` and `VS_UI` | **0** | The clocks work of the C++20 assessment (priority 5): the 32-bit tick wraps every 49.7 days, and every `previous + delay <= now` over it fires early or stalls across the wrap. Counted by `tests/tools/count_tick_reads.pl`, a character-level scanner over comments and string literals, because the regex strip the clocks slices first counted with reads a `//*` line comment as a block opener and swallows live code up to the next `*/` - the failure R11's tool was written for - and so missed the `srand(GetTickCount())` in `VS_UI_Item.cpp` outright (209 in 32 files where this reads 214 in 34). `basic/` is outside the count: its three hits are `Platform.h`'s definitions. Counts calls and definitions alike, so the 186 includes the non-Windows `GetTickCount` shim in `VS_UI_widget.h`, and counts `#if`-disabled code. 214 before the widget timers outside `GameCommon` moved to `MonotonicClock::IntervalTimer`; 100 of the 186 were the two `VS_UI_GameCommon` sources. Added 2026-09-10. **138 later that day:** the interval and window gates in those two sources moved (45 calls), the last `GetTickCount` in `VS_UI` with them - two `srand` seeds reseeded and the `VS_UI_widget.h` stub definition deleted make the 48; `VS_UI` holds 56 `timeGetTime()` sites in three files (the header's `SetTimer` is the third), four of them `srand` seeds and the rest deadline and elapsed-time shapes; `Client` 82. **113 later still:** the deadlines set and read within `VS_UI` and the flag-war end its handler sets moved to `TimePoint` (19 of the 25 calls; the gamble spin's two went to `IntervalTimer` and four are `srand` seeds reseeded from the same tick under another name); the two mission structs `VS_UI` had redeclared from the wire layer became typedefs of it; `VS_UI` holds 33 (the minigames' clocks and the three deadlines the executable sets through shared structs), `Client` 80. **93 on 2026-09-16:** the three minigames' clocks moved to `TimePoint` (20 calls): the minesweeper's start point and the elapsed time it keeps once a game ends (one `DWORD` had held both in turn), the arrow tile's per-character start, end and move points, a trap-delay point nothing sets, and its monster-move gate, and the crazy mine's start point; the elapsed millisecond counts reach the score message as before. `VS_UI` holds 13, the three deadlines the executable sets through shared structs; `Client` 80. **72 later that day:** those three deadlines moved with their setters (21 calls): the quest status's `quest_time` and the war list's `left_time` to `MonotonicClock::SecondPoint`, the whole-second point the `timeGetTime() / 1000` they were counted in floors to, the effect status's `delayFrame` to `TimePoint`. `VS_UI` holds no live call (a dozen mentions inside comments), `Client` 72. **53 later still:** the event register's start stamp (`MEvent::eventStartTickCount`, set by `AddEvent` and reset by the two ending cinematics in `MTopView` as each starts, read by the show-time blink, the expiry, the countdown captions, the scrolls, the fades and two dead script gates through one `ElapsedMillis()`) and the HP-modify list's stamp moved to `TimePoint` (19 calls) - a width and clock change only, since every read was a wrap-safe unsigned subtraction; `MTopView` holds 6, the quest event's parameter fields read as ticks; `MPlayer` 9 (two in its header, feeding the failing `previous + delay < now` shape), `MFakeCreature` 7. **35 later still:** the player's four stamps (the repeat and lock gates and the pet's dissection delay, all three the failing sum shape, and the trace limit, a subtraction), the fake creature's next-move deadline (sum-shaped too) and the two `PacketFunction` setters that fed them moved to `TimePoint` (18 calls); `MTopView` holds 6, the rest ones to fours. **10 on 2026-09-17:** the scatter (25 calls) - the wait screens' double-click gate and the game screen's write-only click stamp, the title fade's start, the `CGVerifyTime` deadline (sum-shaped, read against the frame clock), the update handler's loading stopwatch, the profiler's start stamp, the name window's send stamp (a tick parked in `TempInformation`'s generic `intptr_t` slot, now a `TimePoint` slot of its own), the reconnect handler's two `OUTPUT_DEBUG` stopwatches and the socket stream's byte-rate window (an `IntervalTimer`) moved to the monotonic clock, and `MTopView`'s six went with the quest caption they were in, a block no live event reaches. What is left is the frame clock (`g_CurrentTime`'s three live writers, `g_StartTime`, `CWinUpdate::m_CurrentTime`) and four calls that are not clocks: the two log-file names and the hack check that compares `timeGetTime()` against `GetTickCount()` on purpose. **5 on 2026-09-17:** the frame clock's first slice - one `StampFrameClock()` stamps `g_FrameNow`, a `TimePoint`, beside `g_CurrentTime` (the three writers call it), `CWinUpdate`'s clock members, which nothing outside the class read, are deleted with their two calls, and `g_StartTime` is a `TimePoint`; what is left is that one writer, the two log-file names and the hack check. R16 counts the readers of the `DWORD` from here. **4 on 2026-09-17:** the frame clock's `DWORD` and its writer are gone (the fifteenth slice); the four are the floor - two log-file names that are not clocks, and the hack check that compares two clocks on purpose. **2 later that day:** the code-health follow-up found the hack check was behind an unconditional return. Its body, call and unused timing state are deleted; only the two log-file names remain.  **0 on 2026-09-24:** both diagnostic-log names use the existing 64-bit monotonic clock; their buffers fit the full working directory and suffix. |
| R15 | The five side macros the once-shared sources switched on (`__GAME_CLIENT__`, `__GAME_SERVER__`, `__LOGIN_SERVER__`, `__SHARED_SERVER__`, `__UPDATE_SERVER__`) and the four spellings no translation unit ever had defined that guarded dead code the same way (`__UPDATE_CLIENT__`, `__EXPO_CLIENT__`, `__FULLSCREEN_MODE__` - defined only inside a dead branch - and `__GUILD_MANAGER_TOOL__`): live tokens under `Client/Packet`, live tokens in the rest of the C++ tree, and the names anywhere in a `CMakeLists.txt` or `.cmake` file, three counts checked separately | **0**, **0**, **0** | `__GAME_CLIENT__` was defined for every translation unit that read it (from CMake on three targets and the listed test sources, from `Client_PCH.h` everywhere else) and the other four never were, so a conditional on any of them had one value in every translation unit. Task 5.2's ninth slice evaluated the 190 under `Client/Packet` out (2026-09-13), the tenth the 361 in the rest of the tree and then the definition itself, from `CMakeLists.txt`, `tests/CMakeLists.txt` and `Client_PCH.h` in one commit. The first count keeps a server half behind one of the five from coming back through a copy from the server repo unnoticed (one behind another spelling is the include checker's both-branch walk to catch); the second makes a `#ifdef __GAME_CLIENT__` written from habit fail the suite, since nothing defines it and the guarded code would be dead; the third keeps the name out of the CMake files, where a definition put back would make every such guard live again - matched without word boundaries, because `-D__GAME_CLIENT__` has a word character on each side of the name (the same hole was in R13's CMake count and is closed there too). All three counts pin their file counts (a baseline of 0 cannot notice a shrunken scan); the CMake count does not see `CMakePresets.json`, the workflows or the Makefile, none of which passes a macro today. Counted by `tests/tools/count_identifier.pl`, so a comment or a string does not count - "zero live tokens", never "zero mentions". Blind to a spelling assembled by the preprocessor; a `#define` of the macro in a source file is one token and fails the count. Added 2026-09-13; both source counts at 0 and the CMake count added later that day. **Nine names since 2026-09-16:** the eleventh slice took `__EXPO_CLIENT__` (ten sites) and `__UPDATE_CLIENT__` (one) out, and with them `__FULLSCREEN_MODE__`, which only `__EXPO_CLIENT__` ever defined; `__GUILD_MANAGER_TOOL__` was already at 0 (its three sites went with the tenth slice). 13 live tokens to 0 in the nine files; the pattern names all nine so a guard on any of them written from habit, or copied back, fails the suite the same way. |
| R16 | Live spellings of `g_CurrentTime`, the frame clock's `DWORD`, under `Client` and `VS_UI` | **0** | The frame clock's move (the twelfth clocks slice, 2026-09-17): `g_FrameNow`, a `MonotonicClock::TimePoint` stamped by the same `StampFrameClock()`, sits beside the `DWORD`, and the readers move over a group at a time - the `DWORD` and its one tick call go when this reaches its definition, declarations and writer alone. Counted by `tests/tools/count_identifier.pl` (comments and strings stripped), with a 1,000-file floor on the scan. 144 before the slice; the 57 are the creatures' and the player's member stamps, two of `UserInformation`'s three deadlines (a `gamemodel` member; `GlobalSayTime`'s reads are commented out), `MGameTime`'s two, the item host's clock pointer and the wire host's clock function (two library seams), the debug prints, the writer and the externs. **18 on 2026-09-17:** the creatures' and the player's member stamps moved (nine deadlines in `MCreature` and `MPlayer`, `MFakeCreature`'s inherited read) with their four extern declarations; what is left is `UserInformation`'s two live deadlines and their seven sites, `MGameTime`'s three spellings, the two seams, the definition, the write, one debug print and three externs. **6 on 2026-09-17:** `UserInformation`'s two live deadlines moved behind five small members with a test (`GlobalSayTime`, whose three uses are commented out, deleted) and `MGameTime`'s start and current time take the point; what is left is the two seams, the definition, the write, one debug print and the extern in `Client.h`. **0 on 2026-09-17:** the two seams carry a `TimePoint` (the item host's clock pointer, the wire host's clock function, with their tests and two legacy-wrap cases) and `g_CurrentTime` is deleted; the count stays as the guard that nothing brings the name back. |
| R17 | Unbounded format and copy lines (`sprintf`, `wsprintf`, `strcpy`, `strcat`) under `basic`, `VS_UI` and `Client` outside the packet tree | **0** | The bounded-formatting work of the C++20 assessment (priority 7): R3's grep with `wsprintf` added and headers scanned beside sources, over the rest of the tree, `//` tails stripped, read with `-a` for `VS_UI_GameCommon.cpp`'s NUL bytes. A site leaves it when its destination is a real array and the call is `snprintf(dst, sizeof(dst), ...)` or an exact-length `memcpy`, checked by hand. 1,102 before the first slice (2026-09-17), which took `basic` to 0 (`C_DIRECTORY`, unreferenced and unlinkable on Windows, deleted; PlatformSDL and SafeFormat bounded) and `SpriteLib` to 0; `VS_UI` holds 783, the rest of `Client` 303. **1,016 on 2026-09-17:** the second slice took ten Client utility files to zero (70 lines: `GetWinVersion` takes its buffer's size, `CMd5`, which nothing constructs, deleted with its two files (its 50-byte error text overflowed for a long path nothing supplied), `MMusic`'s error text becomes the `char` array it was cast to, the rest `snprintf(sizeof)` into local arrays, and sixteen lines of block-commented debug code deleted with their blocks). **970 on 2026-09-17:** the third slice took `Client.cpp`, `GameMain.cpp`, `MZone.cpp` and `MCreature.cpp` to zero (46 lines: three live overflows - the Futec parser's 32-byte argument slots, the 128-byte log-file name under a `_MAX_PATH` directory, the 80-byte server-group name from the login server's world list - three `sprintf` calls that read their own destination made appends, the rest `snprintf(sizeof)` or an exact-length `memcpy`, and fifteen dead lines - `get_rand_str` and thirteen block-commented debug dumps - deleted with their blocks). **969 later that day:** remove the unused WinINet downloader and its one `strcpy`. **966 on 2026-09-18:** move `CMessageArray` into `basic` and replace its three unbounded copies with owned filename storage and bounded row copies. **963 later that day:** delete three dead formatting lines with the abandoned GL drawing blocks. **587 on 2026-09-21:** all remaining raw `wsprintf` calls are bounded or removed with an unused API; R18 prevents their return. **586 later that day:** `CToken` replaces `strcpy` with an exact-length copy into owned replacement storage. **584 later that day:** team introduction and billing dialog wrapping replace whole-remainder `strcpy` calls with owned UTF-8 rows. **570 later that day:** descriptors use owned rows and remove the unused substitution buffers (14 counted copy lines). **569 later that day:** rich-help removes the unused substitution loop, including one counted dead copy. **568 later that day:** notice mail date formatting uses the checked formatter. **518 on 2026-09-22:** option names use owned strings and checked indices; their formatted output and percentage appends are bounded. Two obsolete option-rendering blocks are removed (eight of the 50 counted lines).  **512 on 2026-09-24:** retire unused MinTrace formatting paths and bound the two TEXT-wrapped UI literals (six counted lines). **0 on 2026-09-24:** remaining fixed-buffer formatting and text assembly use proven array capacities or named allocation capacities; names, credentials and file paths retain full owned storage. Aliased item/UI string replacement and pixel-measured UTF-8 history wrapping have library regression tests. Remove 108 counted lines with obsolete comment blocks and seven with unused APIs. The original pattern, roots, packet exclusions and file floor are unchanged; this only closes the measured spellings, not all memory-safety debt. |
| R18 | Raw `wsprintf`, `wsprintfA` and `wsprintfW` identifiers | **0** | `tests/tools/count_wsprintf.pl` scans tracked and unignored C/C++ sources and headers, masks comments/literals and joins line splices. It counts aliases as well as calls, pins the source inventory and checks its lexer fixtures. Token-pasted spellings are outside this source check; the POSIX shim is also deleted. |

R7 and R8 exist as a pair on purpose: R7 is precise and blind to
indirection, R8 is coarse and cannot be evaded by spelling. Finding C19's
closure rests on both plus the hand audits listed in the review's C19 entry,
never on either number alone.

**Two checkers sit beside the ratchets**, in `tests/tools/`, because what
they measure needs parsing rather than grepping. `check_format_arity.pl`
(ctest `format_arity`) compares every converted format site's arguments
against the built-in English table in `MGameStringTable.cpp` (which
`InitGameStringTable()` installs over the file data on the English path, so
it is what the default build formats with); it fails when an entry asks for
more arguments than the site passes or a conversion's argument is provably
the other kind, and it floors both the sites it finds (295) and the sites it
resolves (283). `check_packet_indices.pl` (ctest `packet_indices`) is the index
half of code-health priority 1: over `Client/Packet` and
`Client/PacketHandler` it walks packet-derived values into subscripts —
through locals, across lines, one hop — and reports **103**, 91 into a
named, verified `CTypeTable` and a ceiling of **12** into a container that
is not, all guarded today. It read 114 and 13 when this paragraph was
written; `32cef4d2` took out the vampire addon lookup (113, 12), and
`4fa24b9e` turned ten `CTypeTable` writes into `GetMutable(x)` calls,
which answer NULL out of range and which the checker, reading `[]` only,
no longer counts (103). Seven of the 12 are the phone-slot subscripts of
the handlers task 4.15 moved into `gamemodel`; they stay in
`Client/PacketHandler`, so the checker still reads them, and
`test_model_handlers.cpp` runs every out-of-range slot byte past them. Its range-checked list is a named allowlist that
fails closed (when introduced, `CMessageArray::operator[]` truncated rather
than checked; it gained bounds checks on 2026-09-18, but the spelling of a
dereference still cannot prove a container is checked); a thirteenth raw
subscript has to be read before the number moves.

## Phase 1 — `packetwire`: the wire-support library (pilot)

The first extraction, chosen so that no source file needed to change to
move (see *First candidate* at the end) and the result immediately covered
the top-risk area's foundations: streams, framing, crypto, sockets and the
info classes the GC packets delegate their parsing to.

- [x] **1.1 Create the `packetwire` static library** from the game-free
  subset of the `Client/Packet` root.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #34; 51 files then, the whole wire
  > layer bar one file now — see 2.4 and 5.1). Membership is
  > `tests/arch/packetwire_files.txt`, read by CMake, the include checker
  > and the ratchet script; the executable's list drops members by
  > absolute path. Build wiring: `__GAME_CLIENT__` from `Client_PCH.h`
  > (until task 5.2's tenth slice retired it),
  > `__WIN32__`/`__WINDOWS__` on WIN32, include dirs `Client/Packet`,
  > `Client`, `basic`; `DarkEden` and `VS_UI` link it.
  - Owner: the membership file + W0/W1/W2 in the include checker + R1.

- [x] **1.2 Link `packetwire` into `unit_tests`** and land the first parser
  tests. Stream construction in tests goes through a one-line
  `friend class SocketInputStreamTestAccess;` in the stream header
  (access-only, declared unconditionally so the class definition is
  identical in every TU); the helper is `tests/support/packet_stream_access.h`.
  Test TUs compile with the library's own defines (the Windows wire
  macros; `__GAME_CLIENT__=1` as well until task 5.2's tenth slice
  retired it): `Packet`'s virtual set changed under that one and the
  packet headers still switch on the others, so a mismatch is a real
  vtable/ODR break.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #34). Pinned: stream bounds
  > (zero-length rejected, over-read throws `InsufficientDataException`
  > and consumes nothing, wrap-around reassembly), the `read(std::string&,
  > len)` contract including the truncate-at-embedded-NUL-but-consume-
  > full-length asymmetry, `ModifyInfo` and `InventoryInfo` hostile
  > counts. The five allocate → read → push_back parser sites
  > (`InventoryInfo`, `GearInfo`, `ExtraInfo`, `RideMotorcycleInfo`,
  > `PCItemInfo`) push_back before read so a truncated payload does not
  > leak the in-flight slot — a regression guard, because MSVC's ASan
  > does no leak detection.
  - Owner: the tests themselves; `unit_tests` link line.

- [x] **1.3 First test-first fix: `StringStream` stack overflow.**
  `operator<<(float)` did `sprintf(buf, "%f", T)` into `char buf[12]`;
  `double` the same into `buf[22]`. The server fixed this family on its
  side (server RESTRUCTURING 1.4).
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #34). The nine-operator numeric
  > family uses `snprintf` with range-sized buffers (`double` 352 — `%f`
  > of `-DBL_MAX` is 317 characters), and `m_Size` is `size_t` (it was
  > `ushort` and wrapped at 64 KiB, which the widened entries made
  > reachable). Tests pin the exact formatting at each old overflow
  > threshold.
  - Owner: the unit test.

---

## Phase 2 — Strip `execute()`, move the packet classes

The client twin of the server's tasks 2.3/2.4: the migration recipe, the
dispatcher design and the traps are recorded in the server's status notes.
This is what makes the `Gpackets` parsers (priority 1 in the code-health
review) directly unit-testable.

- [x] **2.1 `PacketDispatcher` in `packetwire`.** Table of packet id →
  `void(*)(Packet*, Player*)`, written only at startup; the server's
  `PacketDispatcher.h` shape verbatim, `DE_REGISTER_PACKET_HANDLER` macros
  included.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #37). Fixed `PACKET_MAX` table,
  > unconditional throws on double registration and out-of-range ids,
  > `InvalidProtocolException` from `dispatch` on an unregistered id.
  > All four receive loops (`ClientPlayer`, `Player`,
  > `RequestServerPlayer` - `RequestClientPlayer` was a fifth until task
  > 5.2's eighth slice - and `ClientCommunicationManager` with a NULL
  > player) call
  > `PacketDispatcher::dispatch` unconditionally; the transitional
  > `tryDispatch` fallback was deleted with `Packet::execute` itself in
  > 2.4, so the base class carries no handler entry point, as on the
  > server.
  - Owner: R2 ratchet + the dispatcher unit tests.

- [x] **2.2 Migrate the GC direction** and
- [x] **2.3 Migrate CG / LC / CR-RC / U.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PRs #38 and #39). Every `execute()` body
  > in every direction was mechanically classified and stripped.
  > `Client/PacketHandlerRegistry.cpp` is the composition root, called
  > from `InitSocket()` (per login attempt), idempotent, its flag set
  > after success: the standard delegations, the packet-only handlers
  > (the datagram connection family), the `__BEGIN_DEBUG` thunks (kept
  > for the cout-branch platforms), `GLIncomingConnectionError`'s cout
  > trace, `GCExchangeList` and `CGConnectSetKey` as explicit no-ops.
  > The `DE_REGISTER` thunks carry `__BEGIN_TRY`/`__END_CATCH`, so the
  > per-packet stack-annotation frame the deleted bodies had is kept.
  > The 163 CG `execute()` bodies were deleted unregistered, with
  > `CGHandlersStub.cpp`; the honest basis, written in the registry
  > header: the server never sends CG/CL ids and the bodies were no-ops
  > (`PacketValidator`'s `CPS_NORMAL` accepts any id and
  > `Player::processCommand` has no validator, so the only change is
  > that a protocol-violating peer now disconnects — the server's trade).
  > **The receive loops were never the whole story**: the client
  > fabricates packets locally (skill echoes in `CGameUpdate.cpp`, GM
  > messages in `Client.cpp`, `CGConnectSetKey` on the login and
  > reconnect paths); all route through `PacketDispatcher::dispatch`
  > and R5 owns the rule.
  - Owner: R2 and R5 ratchets.

- [x] **2.4 Move the packet classes into `packetwire`**, plus
  `PacketFactoryManager` / `PacketValidator` / `PacketIDSet`; handlers move
  to `Client/PacketHandler/`, compiled into the exe, so `Client/Packet` is
  wire-only and the include checker locks the whole directory.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-01, PR #41). Handlers moved by pure `git
  > mv` after one prep commit qualified their includes
  > (`"Gpackets/GCSay.h"`); the never-compiled CG handlers were deleted.
  > The last game reaches came out by seam: `CLLogin`'s
  > `g_pUserInformation` read is a packet member the sender sets,
  > `WHISPER_MESSAGE` sits beside `CRWhisper`, five root info classes
  > moved under `Client/Packet`, two dead `__GAME_SERVER__` bodies that
  > built wire fields from live game objects were deleted.
  > `PacketDiagnostics` is the hook through which `Datagram::read`
  > reports without linking the executable; since 5.1 it is an
  > interception point (how a test captures the text), and reporting goes
  > straight to the library's `SendBugReport` when no hook is installed.
  > **Goldens (the owner):** `test_packet_goldens.cpp` writes through the
  > real streams and pins the `.hex` files under `tests/golden/`, **54 of
  > them byte-identical copies of the server's** (all 19 encrypter packets at codes 0–5, GCMoveOK
  > framed, CGSay, CGWhisper) — `diff -r` of the two golden directories
  > is the cross-repo check. The first run found a real wire defect:
  > `CGMove` at encrypt code 0 wrote x,y,dir where the server reads
  > dir,x,y, and code 0 is reachable (the session code cancels for zone
  > 1301 in the shipped data); fixed on the client, the reading side
  > being the authority. Two asymmetries are pinned as fact-tests:
  > `CLLogin::read` here is one byte short of the login server's, and
  > `GCDropItemToZone` round-trips here while the server pins only its
  > `write()`. `test_packet_factories.cpp` proves the link for the
  > received directions and pins that the manager refuses CG and
  > out-of-range ids.
  > **Deliberately not done then** (task 5.2's ninth and tenth slices
  > took them on 2026-09-13): the ~186 `__GAME_SERVER__`/`__GAME_CLIENT__`
  > conditionals in 157 packet sources (they have one meaning in every
  > target, so the checker evaluates them; sweeping the dead server
  > halves is 5.2 work), and goldens for the ~500 unpinned packets.
  - Owner: W0/W1 over the whole `Client/Packet` tree; the goldens; the
    factory link test.

- [x] **2.5 Retire the wire-inventory workaround.** `test_wire_layout.cpp`
  calls the real factories instead of perl-lifted method bodies;
  `tests/wire-layout.txt` stays byte-compatible with the server's
  `wire_inventory_diff.sh`.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-02, PR #42). `tests/generated/WireInventory.inc`
  > has the server's registry shape (one include and one registration per
  > factory class; `gen_wire_inventory.pl` emits it, `wire_inventory_fresh`
  > pins it, and the generator refuses a `getPacketName()` spelling it
  > cannot check). The test constructs every factory and its packet (the
  > link proof for the written CG/CL directions), checks id uniqueness,
  > and checks every id `PacketFactoryManager::init()` serves is a listed
  > factory at its own max size. Rpackets are constructed but kept out of
  > the rendered file. Two divergences went first: 112 factory classes
  > had been compiled out of every client build (`__DEBUG_OUTPUT__`,
  > `__GAME_CLIENT__` guards) and are unconditional now, and `CRRequest2`,
  > a dead duplicate of `PACKET_CR_REQUEST`, is deleted. Two wire defects
  > found and fixed test-first: `GCUpdateInfo`'s constructor never
  > initialised `m_pBloodBibleSign` while its destructor deletes it (a
  > truncated body freed a garbage pointer); and `GCAddItemToItemVerify`
  > read two parameters for `UP_GRADE_OK` where the server writes one, so
  > every successful item-grade upgrade over-read four bytes into the next
  > packet (its `write()` also dropped both `THREE_ENCHANT_OK` parameters;
  > the handler now sets the grade the server sends). The other seven
  > packets a cross-repo sweep had flagged are identical layouts.
  - Owner: `wire_inventory_fresh`; the all-factory construction in
    `test_wire_layout.cpp`; the `GCAddItemToItemVerify` goldens.

**Phase exit criteria:** met — R2 = 0; `Client/Packet` contains no handler
code; parser fixes are written test-first against real packet objects;
live-server smoke tests passed per slice.

---

## Phase 3 — The fix policy (in force from Phase 1 onward)

Not a code phase — the standing rule this plan exists to enable, stated once:

- [x] **3.1 Every fix names its test path in the commit message.** One of:
  (a) *lib + test* — the code is in a static library and the fix commit
  contains the test; (b) *moved, then fixed* — the fix's first commit moves
  the unit into a library, the second fixes it test-first; (c) *exempt* —
  the code is on the exemption list, the commit says so and carries the
  regression-guard wording. A fix commit that is none of the three is wrong.
  > **Status:** adopted 2026-09-02; enforced since PR #53 by
  > `tools/git-hooks/commit-msg`, which refuses a `fix:` commit without a
  > `Test path:` line naming one of the three (no bypass flag on purpose;
  > mode 100755, pattern anchored). Installed per clone with
  > `git config core.hooksPath tools/git-hooks` — CLAUDE.md carries the
  > instruction. Review-round repair commits are not exempt.
  - Owner: the hook.

The creature allocator is now directly testable in `basic/MemoryPool`, with
its four creature-specific pool instances retained in `Client/MemoryPool.cpp`.
`tests/unit/test_memory_pool.cpp` owns the size, alignment, membership and
reuse contracts; the move and the behavior change are separate commits.

---

## Phase 4 — Game-model extraction

Background work, one class family per branch, each independently mergeable.
Target library: `gamemodel` — links `basic` + `packetwire` + `framelib`
+ `decore` (the server's rules, vendored; task 4.12) (+ iconv for
`MString`), **no** SDL/dxlib/VS_UI. Membership is
`tests/arch/gamemodel_files.txt` (`.cpp` lines compiled, `.h` lines
allowed in the closure), read by CMake, which removes each member from the
executable by absolute path and asserts it, by the include checker (M0–M2)
and by the ratchet script (R4). Extraction means adding a file to that list
and cutting its `g_p*`/UI seams through a host struct the executable
installs at start-up (`MItemHost`, `MPriceHost`; see *What the review
rounds settled* for the host rules). Test fixtures share
`tests/support/gamemodel_world.h`.

- [x] **4.0 Compile the VS_UI client sources once.** The 36 `Client/*.cpp`
  files on `VS_UI_CLIENT_SOURCES` were compiled into both `VS_UI` and the
  executable (the list was relative, the exe's `REMOVE_ITEM` absolute, so
  it never matched — the LNK4217 noise CLAUDE.md used to describe).
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-02, PRs #46 and #47). The list is gone and
  > the files compile once, into the executable, which is the side that
  > linked all along: a linker map of `DarkEden.exe` before and after
  > (989,469 symbol → object rows, 0 differ) is the proof. `_LIB` is
  > `PUBLIC` on the `VS_UI` target: its ~100 `#ifndef _LIB` regions are
  > the standalone UI test harness, some of them class members, so the
  > 72 executable translation units that include VS_UI headers must see
  > the same layout the library's objects do. Unverified, not knowingly
  > broken: on `NOT WIN32` `Client/Client.cpp` stays in `VS_UI` (the
  > non-Windows executable filters out its WinMain).
  - Owner: the linker-map comparison (in PR #46); R4 no longer parses a
    CMake list.

- [x] **4.1 Pure tables first:** `ExperienceTable`, `MItemOptionTable`,
  `MGameStringTable`, `MSoundTable`, `SystemAvailabilities`, `FameInfo`.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-02, PR #44). `gamemodel` exists with the
  > six tables, `ExpInfo`, `MString`, `MStringArray`. Seams cut:
  > `UseEnglishText` takes the `Properties` table (`UseEnglishTextFrom`
  > underneath is the testable core), and
  > `SystemAvailabilitiesManager::LoadFromStream(std::istream&)` takes
  > the lines `GameInit.cpp` reads out of the archive — the shape every
  > later file loader took. Fixed test-first: `ITEMOPTION_TABLE::LoadFromFile`
  > wrote part names past two fixed `MAX_PART` arrays for whatever count
  > the file declared; `ITEMTABLE_INFO`'s constructor left `Price`,
  > `Race`, `DropFrameID` unset. **Known, not fixed:** a refused
  > item-option table leaves the part-name `MString`s NULL and three
  > `VS_UI` call sites `strcpy` them unguarded (pre-existing for any
  > unset part; the alternative was heap corruption at startup).
  > `CToken` also joins unchanged (2026-09-21). `test_token.cpp` links the
  > actual tokenizer and pins token order, remainder ownership and null resets.
  > An ASan test then reproduced `SetString` reading a token after freeing its
  > own buffer. Replacement now copies before releasing the previous string;
  > interior/long tokens, suffixes and empty terminators have lifetime tests.
  > The action and effect tables join `gamemodel` (2026-09-29):
  > `MActionInfoTable` (`Action.inf`), `MEffectSpriteTypeTable`
  > (`EffectSpriteType.inf` and the per-action frames of
  > `ActionEffectSpriteType.inf`), `MEffectStatusTable` (`EffectStatus.inf`)
  > and `MCreatureSpriteTable` (`CreatureSprite.inf`), with their globals.

  their enum definitions.
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-17, PR #172, `ad86a5aa`).

- [ ] **4.12 Shared rules library:** the rules the client and the server both
  compute are implemented once, in the server's de-core (`src/domain`), and
  this repo builds a byte-identical, hash-manifested copy of a listed subset,
  `third_party/decore/` (the server's task 3.6 is the other half). Six slices,
  each a server change and then this repo's: (1) the shop buy, sell and repair
  price and the maximum durability; (2) the per-class grade policy and
  durability class table; (3) callers of the existing de-core functions (this
  repo only); (4) equip requirements; (5) the castle tax; (6)
  `SkillOutputFormulas` and the small rules.
  > **Status:** the client halves of all six slices are in (slice 6 on
  > `feat/shared-skill-rules`); the task stays open for what each slice
  > leaves over below, which needs the owner's decisions (the plan's
  > section 8) or the data export its section 7 names. Slice 1 is in: `MPriceManager`'s
  > buy, sell and repair quotes and the gear maximum durability call
  > `decore`, the inputs the server never sends are `MPriceHost` entries
  > with documented defaults, and `unit_tests` checks the adapters against
  > the vector rows. Slice 2 is in: `MGearItem`'s grade getters (maximum
  > durability, damage, critical, defense, protection, luck) read
  > `decore::gradePolicyOf`, `hasDurability` and `gradeOffsets` by the item
  > class. Four classes keep rules of their own rather than the table's:
  > the two couple rings, which the server builds outside `ConcreteItem`
  > (the client keeps the ring's rule and quotes their repair at the
  > server's 0); `MBloodBibleSign`, which the client makes itself and which
  > keeps the gear rule of 1000 a grade; and `MMotorcycle`, which keeps its
  > own maximum, since the server's is a placeholder 1. Dermis, Fascia, CarryingReceiver and
  > CoreZap start their maximum from the server info's 1, not the table.

  > second-stage pet to an owner under quest level 40, which the

  > register holds, which `IsQuestItem` counts (`isRealWearing` asks a
  > time-limited item only its gender, and an ousters nothing), and
  > the client's own only for an item flagged a quest item
  > (`m_Quest`). The fourth is the server's: `Slayer` and
  > `Vampire::isRealWearing` let a couple ring through
  > (`isCoupleRing`) after their time-limited and premium-zone gates,
  > before any requirement, and `Ousters::isRealWearing` has no such

- [x] **4.49 Creature guidance and chase:** `MGuidanceEffect` and
  `MChaseEffect` compile in `gamemodel`. A borrowed `MGuidanceEffectHost`
  returns creature pixel X/Y and height; GameInit installs the live-zone
  adapter and clears it at shutdown. Missing hosts, entries or creatures

- [x] **4.51 Parabolic-effect lifecycle:** `MParabolaEffect` compiles in
  `gamemodel`, including construction and configuration of cannonade smoke.
  `MParabolaEffectHost` supplies sprite metadata, an ownership-taking smoke
  queue and cannonade impact execution. GameInit installs and clears it.
  Missing metadata skips creation; missing queue/impact services discard
  that output. Readers are private, guarded and re-read on each call.
  > Movement advances before smoke is emitted, then landing snaps the
  > projectile and ends its lifetime before impact. Arrival returns before
  > sector projection, animation and light. Smoke owns its frame, position,

  borrowed identity to a reader without dereferencing it in the model.

  > **Status:** done (2026-10-02). The base effect animates and refreshes
  > light before an active, running orbit advances. Pausing the orbit keeps attachment animation active;

### Remaining R1 work after tasks 4.80-4.87

A fresh Linux Ninja inventory contains 344 executable sources: 263 packet
handlers, 13 other effect-named files and 68 other files. These are inventory
categories, not independent modules. Windows retains two additional sources.

Continue with reviewable boundaries: `GCRegenZoneStatusHandler` updates the
existing UI-owned regen-tower model; the remaining generators need their actual
creature/world services identified; larger handler groups need extracted
player/creature and world state before they can run without the executable.
`MPlayer`, `MCreature`, `MZone`, `MTopView` and `UIMessageManager` remain major
coupled implementations. Each slice needs production-object link evidence and
contract tests, not merely a new static-library wrapper.

Literal zero also requires an explicit bootstrap design: `SDLMain.cpp` and
`Client.cpp` provide platform entry points and are currently counted. This
slice adds no exemptions or changes to R1's denominator. Decide the entry-point
boundary before claiming that the whole client has reached zero.

## Phase 5 — Long tail

- [x] **5.1 Split the debug facilities** so `DebugInfo.h`/`MinTr.h` stop
  gating `packetwire` membership. The task named `SocketAPI.cpp`,
  `DatagramSocket.cpp` and `NPCInfo.cpp`; the real list was
  `tests/arch/packetwire_holdouts.txt`, and the task became "take the
  holdouts in".
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-09, fifth slice; PR #144). **Every `.cpp`
  > under `Client/Packet` is a `packetwire` member**; the holdouts file
  > lists nothing and stays only because W0 reads it and the next
  > holdout needs somewhere to be written down. The last one,
  > `RequestClientPlayerManager.cpp`, went behind nine `WireHost`
  > entries and was deleted four hours later: the review
  > of the move found that the whisper mode it served was compiled out
  > upstream (`0 &&` around every writer of the queue and every
  > whisper-mode `Connect()` - see *A reference on a live line can
  > still be dead*), and reading on from there showed the whole
  > outbound peer side - this client dialling other clients for a
  > profile or a whisper - was dead with it: `GCRequestedIPHandler`
  > began `if (bKorean == false || 1) return;`, so no peer address ever
  > arrived from the server. 5.2's seventh and eighth slices deleted the
  > lot (same PR); what the request-service family keeps in the library
  > is the **inbound** side - `RequestServerPlayer` and its manager,
  > peers dialling this client - and `WireHost` is down to **11
  > entries**, the fourth slice's clock and three file-sender calls
  > among them. The move itself is in the PR's first commit for anyone
  > who needs the seam again. **Kept from the work, both test-first:**
  > `CRWhisper::isSlayer()` compared against `RACE_VAMPIRE`;
  > `CRWhisper::write` checked every length and not the race and now
  > refuses one outside the three before writing a byte (the packet is
  > still received; `test_crwhisper.cpp`). The host installers in
  > `GameInit.cpp` and the tests are **designated initialisers**
  > (C++20); the "checked by reading" caveat the fourth slice recorded
  > is retired.
  > Done before that (PRs #63, #64, #74, #75): the logging facility
  > (`DebugLog.{h,cpp}`) lives in `basic/`, so every library may log and
  > the one object is no longer compiled into two libraries; `DebugInfo.h`
  > is one `#include "MinTr.h"` above two no-op macros and nothing in the
  > wire layer includes it. **`Client/Packet/WireHost.h`** declares what
  > the wire layer asks of the program around it — the three
  > `ClientConfig` tuning values, the millisecond clock, the encrypt-seed
  > inputs (zone id, server number, region flags), and three calls on the
  > peer file-transfer manager (six, and an in-game test, until the
  > eighth slice), which stays executable-side because it writes the
  > profile directory and reads the UI — and the
  > executable fills it in beside the other two hosts in `GameInit`; every
  > tuning accessor answers without a host with the value `ClientConfig`'s own
  > constructor sets, and `WIRE_DEFAULT_*` keeps the executable's
  > fallbacks from drifting. `SendBugReport` is `WireHost.cpp`'s second
  > half. `setEncryptCode()` **is live code** (`Encrypter.h` defines
  > `__USE_ENCRYPTER__`; `GCUpdateInfoHandler` calls it on every login),
  > and `WireEncryptSeed`'s four region branches collapse to two distinct
  > expressions, which a test asserts across every server number.
  > Fixed test-first: `Player`'s socket constructor never set
  > `pHashTable`, which `delKey()` (two live callers, both on every
  > reconnect) `delete[]`s — both constructors set it, the destructor
  > frees it, `setKey` frees the previous table; `Wire::ReceiveMyRequest`
  > and `SendOtherRequest` no longer declare `throw ()` over a manager
  > that throws by design. Seven `OUTPUT_DEBUG` blocks and `ProcessMode`'s
  > commented-out body were deleted rather than moved, because R4 counts
  > a `g_p*` name on a dead line as readily as on a live one.
  > **Was untested by construction** until the fifth slice's review: the
  > host installation in `GameInit.cpp` was positional, so transposing
  > two same-signature entries in `s_WireHost` compiled and passed the
  > whole suite; it is designated now, and the forwarder test proves
  > that each `WireHost.cpp` forwarder calls its matching member. **Known, not fixed:** `SocketImpl`'s default
  > constructor is the only one of its four that leaves `m_key` unset;
  > `Player::processCommand`, `processInput`, `processOutput`,
  > `sendPacket`, `disconnect` and `toString` dereference the socket or a
  > stream the default constructor leaves NULL.

    address-taking link proofs (non-virtual members — see *What the
    review rounds settled*).

- [x] **5.2 Dead/duplicate source removal** (code-health priority 3).

  - Owner: the build (nothing deleted was compiled, so R1 held at each
    step); the wrong-file-edited trap is closed for the files named;
    **R15** for the ninth, tenth and eleventh slices - the nine macros
    as live tokens under `Client/Packet` and outside it, 0 and 0, and
    their definitions in the CMake files, 0.

- [x] **5.5 Sprite-pack input and rejection diagnostics.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-22). Both `CTypePack` templates validate complete
  > matching counts and in-file offsets before replacing lazy-load state.
  > Rejected entries are attempted once per load; revisiting one cannot close

  > Empty loads clear prior state; invalid index reloads preserve it.
  - Owner: `test_ctypepack_indexed.cpp`, real sprite and template instantiations,
    plus full build, architecture and sanitizer checks. Broader asset-format
    auditing remains in the code-health review's caveats.

- [x] **5.6 Pixel-sprite input validation.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-22). `CSprite555` and `CSprite565` share the
  > checked `CSprite::LoadPixels` implementation. Header and row reads must
  > complete; encoded runs and cumulative pixel widths are validated before
  > publication. A shipped one-column width discrepancy is normalized into the
  > reported width; larger overruns and 16-bit width overflow are rejected.
  > Complete malformed records consume every row before rejection,
  > keeping the next packed sprite readable. Only color words convert to 555;
  > padding survives. Truncation/exception paths clear data and loading state.
  - Owner: `test_pixel_sprite_loading.cpp` and the existing 555 cursor tests,
    exercised with the actual SpriteLib implementations under ASan.

- [x] **5.7 Shadow-sprite input validation.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-22). `CShadowSprite` checks complete headers and
  > rows, encoded pair counts and cumulative width before publishing data.
  > Complete rejected records retain the next packed-record cursor; truncated
  > or throwing reads release pending rows and leave an empty object. Explicit
  > release also resets complete empty-header state. Row padding is preserved.
  - Owner: `test_shadow_sprite_loading.cpp`, exercising the actual loader,
    drawing, maximum lengths, reloads and release under ASan.

- [x] **5.8 Shadow-sprite copy ownership.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-22). Copy construction and assignment own their
  > rows independently, preserve self-assignment and empty initialized records,
  > and start without a borrowed backend cache. Loaded and generated rows retain
  > allocation spans; copies validate those spans before reading, preserve
  > padding, and reject corrupted source rows. Pending copies use scoped owners.
  - Owner: `test_shadow_sprite_loading.cpp`, covering independent destruction,
    real backend caches, all three generated forms and malformed source rows.

- [x] **5.9 Shadow-sprite adapter bounds.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-22). The SDL shadow adapter validates retained
  > row spans before creating or refreshing a backend sprite. Empty geometry
  > and rasters beyond the backend's signed pixel-count limit are rejected
  > before allocation. Raster multiplication and row strides use `size_t`.
  - Owner: the `ShadowSpriteAdapter` cases in `test_shadow_sprite_loading.cpp`,
    covering the reproduced overflow, dirty caches and geometry boundaries.

- [x] **5.10 Effect-shadow resource loading.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). `MTopView::InitSprites` loads the small
  > effect-shadow pack eagerly through the checked generic pack loader, matching
  > the effect viewer. It reports and propagates failure instead of depending
  > on the installed index's unsupported wrapper. Other packs retain lazy loads.
  - Owner: `ShadowSpriteLoading.EagerPackReadsAllRecordsWithoutTheLegacyIndex`,
    the production-loader asset audit and full builds for the game-side wiring.

- [x] **5.11 Light-filter pack input validation.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). `CFilterPack` checks complete counts and
  > filter records before replacing the current pack; invalid reloads preserve
  > all prior filters. An explicit empty pack clears storage. Pending filter
  > rows remain releasable if allocation throws. Game initialization reports
  > and propagates rejected or empty light packs, and both light draw paths
  > skip empty packs before calculating an index.
  - Owner: the `CFilterPack` cases in `test_cfilter.cpp`; full builds cover the
    game-side connection. The installed `Light2D.ftp` passes the production
    loader under ASan with all 12 records consumed and no trailing bytes.

- [x] **5.12 Specialized alpha-pack input and ownership.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). `CAlphaSpritePack` owns and indexes typed
  > 555/565 arrays and cannot be shallow-copied. Full reloads validate complete
  > records before publication. Partial loads validate the whole destination
  > range first, report rejected rows and retain earlier complete rows. Indexed
  > reads check both file headers, IDs and offsets and rewind a reused index.
  > Empty initialization releases prior storage; invalid element access throws.
  - Owner: `test_alpha_sprite_pack.cpp`, linking the real library API in both
    formats. This specialized pack has no active game construction; the live
    effect-alpha resource uses `CAlphaSpritePalPack` instead.

- [x] **5.13 File-index table input validation.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). `CFileIndexTable` stages complete little-endian
  > counts and signed 32-bit offsets before publication. Rejected reloads keep
  > the previous table; copies own their storage and lookup checks the full ID.
  > Title loading publishes only a successfully decoded sprite. The disconnect
  > screen retains three owned empty sprites when an index or record fails and
  > continues its existing shutdown flow, with source/ID diagnostics.
  - Owner: nine `test_file_index_table.cpp` cases, plus existing production
    sprite-reader tests. The installed `UI.spk` passes the changed index reader
    and both pixel decoders for all six indexed records under ASan. Game-side
    wiring uses the executable exemption and full builds.

- [x] **5.14 Game sprite-pack failure propagation.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). `MTopView::InitSprites` checks all 26 active
  > lazy sprite/palette opens and propagates rejected indexes. Eager screen
  > palettes, effect shadows, miscellaneous sprites and weather sprites clear
  > partially loaded packs after rejection. The Ousters ending stops before
  > drawing unless its pack loads and contains all eleven required sprites.
  > Empty miscellaneous/weather packs also fail initialization; clearing the
  > failed pack permits later retries through the existing size check.
  > Startup and display restoration stop through existing cleanup/quit paths
  > on view failure. The tile renderer is discarded before replacing its
  > borrowed surface, preventing stale references and leaks during retry.
  - Owner: existing `CTypePack` and concrete decoder tests; these game-coupled
    branches use the executable exemption, full builds and a comment-aware
    caller audit. Offline ASan validation covers the production loading paths,
    including both effect palettes (5,126 decoder calls in both pixel formats).

- [x] **5.15 Ending sprite-pack failure cleanup.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). The advancement ending requires a complete
  > seven-sprite pack and validates its selected pair before adding one to the

  - Owner: existing sprite-pack decoder tests, full builds and a source audit
    of the event setters, flags, cleanup and draw callers. These executable
    integrations are regression guards. All seven installed advancement sprites
    pass the production eager loader in both pixel formats under ASan.

- [x] **5.16 Guild-mark indexed input.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). The guild-mark loader uses the checked pack
  > index reader's four-byte offsets on every platform. It requires both IDs,
  > independently seeks and decodes the large/small sprites, and publishes
  > only a complete owned pair. Failure retains the existing negative-cache
  > policy and remains false on repeated calls; missing mapper entries are safe.
  - Owner: `test_ctypepack_indexed.cpp` owns the shared index/decode contracts;
    pixel-loader tests own record bounds. Game cache publication uses the named
    exemption and full builds. All 4,758 installed guild-mark records pass the
    same index helper and both pixel decoders under ASan (9,516 decoder calls).

- [x] **5.17 Partial sprite-load results.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). Both generic pack variants return rejected
  > lazy-record results from range/set preloads, including cached failures
  > after the input stream closes. They validate ranges and IDs, retain valid
  > later rows and preserve the absent-sprite sentinel. Set iteration uses its
  > actual end rather than a narrowed 16-bit count. Addon/creature callers do
  > not mark failed preloads complete, and zone loading follows its existing
  > quit/priority-reset path when tile preload or image-pack reopening fails.
  - Owner: four `test_ctypepack_indexed.cpp` cases cover results, bounds,
    sentinels, full ID sets and valid empty sprites, with three test-first cases
    reproducing 24 failed checks. Game-side integration is a regression guard.

- [x] **5.18 Output queue budget.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). The output ring has a 16 MiB capacity ceiling,
  > including its empty sentinel, enforced on construction, resize and writes.
  > Automatic growth reserves space geometrically. Rejection preserves queued
  > bytes; packet rejection restores the frame and sequence through the existing
  > rollback path. A drained ring retains its bounded allocation for reuse.
  - Owner: four test-first cases in `test_output_stream_flush.cpp` reproduce
    22 failed checks and cover growth, the exact limit, wrapped backpressure,
    header/body rejection and resumed delivery. The wire inventory checks that
    four copies of every declared maximum frame fit within the budget.

- [x] **5.19 Effect selection diagnostics.**
  > **Status:** done (2026-09-23). Both surface effect selectors validate the
  > table index and report unavailable effects once per effect/family, with one
  > bounded bucket for invalid IDs. Missing selections retain the plain-copy
  > fallback. The supported pixel grayscale/gradation and palette screen paths
  > remain registered; unsafe legacy palette routines remain disabled.
  - Owner: two `test_spritesurface_pal_blit.cpp` cases cover diagnostics,
    repeated selections, fallback pixels, supported entries and the table-end
    sentinel. Before the fix, the sentinel produced an ASan global-buffer
    overflow and absent diagnostics produced two failed checks.

## Build and review follow-up (2026-09-18)

Table reads now expose const rows; `CTypeTable::GetMutable` and `Set` reject
invalid writes without publishing a shared fallback. Callers use checked
mutation for skills, status, sprite state and text initialization. The owners
are `test_type_table_access.cpp` and `test_experience_input.cpp`; the latter
also pins count, level, truncation and record-boundary handling for all ten
experience loaders. The format checker parses the migrated built-in string
setters and retains its site and resolution floors.

Skill-domain experience loading also publishes only complete rows. The manager
validates its record count and domain IDs, preserves failed stream state, and
leaves existing experience unchanged when a count or row is truncated.
`test_skill_core.cpp` owns these input and following-record contracts.

Item-option tables publish only complete validated records; failed reloads
retain their prior names and rows. Their name arrays are private, with checked
owned-string access for UI callers and race-specific mana labels. Option
formatting and percentage suffixes respect the output capacity.
`test_gamemodel_tables.cpp` owns malformed-input, reload and name contracts.

`MItem` destruction notifies its host to invalidate borrowed tooltip pointers
for every owning container and direct deletion path. The executable connects
that identity-only notification to `UI_RemoveDescriptor`, which clears either
tooltip payload, and clears the host after shutdown releases the item owners.
`test_item_lifetime.cpp` owns destruction, container and address-reuse contracts;
the callback must not read the already destroyed subtype.

`Player` no longer owns the unused transport hash table or key setters, and
socket streams no longer expose no-op setters. Reconnect paths retain their
connection packets; the separate per-field encryption and packet layouts are
unchanged. `test_player_base.cpp` owns the surviving player contracts, while
`test_packet_goldens.cpp` pins the plain login and encrypted field bytes.

The scrollbar's position calculations now live in `basic/ScrollRange.h`,
inherited by the real UI widget. The move preserves the existing behavior;
the following fix makes the state private, clamps updates, validates pixel
geometry, and bounds container counts before subtraction and narrowing.
Nine `test_scroll_range.cpp` tests own these contracts, including the
reproduced negative positions and divide-by-zero. Sprite ownership, skin
dimensions, and drawing stay in `VS_UI`.

Source globs now trigger CMake regeneration when files are added or removed.
The optional map viewer follows `BUILD_ENGINE`; the effect viewer no longer
links an unused engine library. Hand-written CMake modules and Makefiles are
visible to Git, while local compilation databases stay ignored. The unused
Emscripten workflow was removed. GNU Make and the effect-viewer helper select
portable job counts and explicit build configurations; README documents their
options. A direct MSBuild target can need a retry after a source-list change if it
loaded the old project before CMake regenerated it.

`basic` and `packetwire` now publish the SDL and Windows wire definitions
their public headers require. Consumers inherit them through target links,
including VS_UI and newly added test sources. The manual list of test files
needing wire macros is gone; a consumer compiled without source-specific
defines guards the contract and reproduced both missing-definition failures.

The timer-manager follow-up keeps only live callbacks, releases deleted
storage, and preserves unique IDs so stale handles cannot target replacements.
Storage is allocated inside `Add`, preserving an allocation-free global
constructor and recoverable allocation failure. Tests cover storage churn,
stale handles, callbacks that delete/replace themselves and ID exhaustion,
alongside the existing monotonic-time tests.

`TArray` now has one implementation in `basic`, with compatibility headers
in SpriteLib and framelib. Its existing tests exercise all include paths.
The unused `CDataTable` raw-object serializer is deleted, and 43 top-level
client includes now name the actual relative path to `Platform.h`.

The indexed-sprite 555/565 loaders now share checked header and row decoding.
Complete rejected sprites leave the following packed record readable, while
truncation leaves an empty object and failed stream. Encoded counts, decoded
width and palette indices are validated before publication; conversion changes
only fixed colors. `test_index_sprite_loading.cpp` owns these contracts and
empty-sprite release state. Rejection diagnostics are owned by task 5.5;
the [2026-09-23 asset audit](sprite-asset-audit-2026-09-23.md) records offline
production-loader validation and its explicit coverage limits.

The unused GL import and TGA/IMG interfaces are deleted, together with their
abandoned UI drawing comments. VS_UI uses the existing SDL surface helper;
it no longer imports declarations from the missing legacy graphics DLL.

MSVC compiles every C/C++ target with UTF-8 source and execution encoding.
The source-encoding CTest checks the repository's C/C++ files, and the unit
suite compares narrow literals from BOM and non-BOM sources with explicit
UTF-8 bytes. Existing UTF-8 BOMs are supported; they do not change literal bytes.

`ui_tests` links the real VS_UI library for independently reachable components.
Button tests cover default state, callback dispatch and event-button image
selection. The Windows feedback pointer lives with its existing CImm adapter,
so these tests link that adapter without the game UI loop or fake globals.

The same UI target tests SkinManager through its actual CRarFile reader.
Header tokens use owned strings, coordinate rows are checked before insertion,
and rejected reloads preserve the last valid skin.

The code-health review also records 18 previously completed fixes that still
had open headings, with their current source/test evidence. These status
corrections do not claim new runtime reproductions. Live-server verification
remains optional and is not a merge or completion requirement.

## First candidate (decided 2026-09-01)

**Task 1.1: the `packetwire` library.** Chosen over the alternatives
because:

1. **Zero-edit move.** Every member file's includes were scanned; none
   reached game code, so the move commit was pure CMake — the safest
   possible first step for agents to execute and review.
2. **It sits under the #1 open risk.** The info classes *are* the parsers
   the GC packets delegate server-supplied data to; the streams are where
   every length check ultimately lands. Tests aimed there have the highest
   defect yield per hour — and the first known defect was already queued
   (task 1.3, the `StringStream` float/double stack overflow, already
   proven real on the server's identical copy).
3. **It unblocks Phase 2.** The dispatcher, and eventually all 700+ packet
   classes, land in this target; creating it first meant every later phase
   was "grow the membership list", not "invent a target".

Runner-up considered and deferred: extracting `ExperienceTable`-class pure
tables (4.1) — testable, but it neither touched the top risk nor unblocked
anything else.
