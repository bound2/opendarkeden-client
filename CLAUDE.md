# OpenDarkEden Client

Isometric horror MMORPG client — slayers, vampires, ousters. Korean original from
roughly 2000-2010, ported from Win32 + DirectX to SDL2. C++20, CMake, MSVC.

`README.md` is the human setup guide: prerequisites, vcpkg, generating the solution,
running the game, troubleshooting. **Link to it rather than restating it.** This file
is the working brief for an agent in this repo.

## Build

Windows + MSVC is the live path. There are two Debug trees and neither subsumes the
other, because `/RTC1` and `/fsanitize=address` are mutually exclusive:

| Tree | Flags | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `build/vs2022` | `/RTC1` | uninitialised locals, stack frame damage |
| `build/vs2022-asan` | `/fsanitize=address` | heap/stack overflow, use-after-free, double free |

Use the ordinary tree day to day; switch to the sanitized one to chase a memory error.
README has the full table. Configure prints exactly one of the two check-set lines — if
neither appears, the flags are wrong.

```bash
cmake --build build/vs2022 --config Debug -- -m
```

Ignore the Makefile's `make debug-asan` and friends: they target Unix build dirs
(`build/debug-asan`) and are not the path used here.

The **first** configure of a fresh tree must pass the vcpkg toolchain or SDL2 is not
found:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/vs2022 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

`build/` is gitignored and bakes absolute paths into the generated projects —
regenerate locally, never commit it. `/MP` is set once for all targets in
`CMakeLists.txt`; if it ever looks missing, fix it there and never in a generated
`.vcxproj`, which the next configure discards.

### Reading build output

A clean build is **~27,000 warnings and 0 errors**. The noise is pre-existing: C4290
across `Client/Packet/**` (LNK4217/LNK4286 used to join it while 36 `Client/*.cpp`
files compiled into both `DarkEden` and `VS_UI.lib`; `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` task 4.0
ended that). Judge a build by `error C####`, `error LNK`, `error MSB`
or `fatal error` — never by grepping `"error"`, which matches ~2,700 identifiers such
as `GCMoveErrorHandler`. Redirect builds to a log file; piping through `tail` buffers
the output and hides all progress.

## Testability

### What can be tested

Only code compiled into a **static library**: `basic`, `SpriteLib`, `dxlib`,
`gamemodel` (the pure data tables, the item table, the money manager, the item
core - `MItem`, the gear families, the item managers, the containers
(inventory, storage, shop shelves), the trade manager over them, the gear the
three races wear and the shop, behind the `MItemHost` the executable installs,
the price manager behind its `MPriceHost`, and the skill core (the info
table, the skill set, the domains and their tree; what the player can use
right now stays executable-side) - with the user, config and
timed-item loaders it reads, and their string support, membership in
`tests/arch/gamemodel_files.txt` —
`docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` tasks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4),
`framelib`, `TextSystem`, `VS_UI`, and `packetwire` — the whole wire layer: the
sockets (TCP and datagram), the socket streams, the `Player` base under all three
player classes, the
encrypter, the info classes, every packet class in every direction and
the factory/validator tables (`docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` tasks 1.1, 2.4 and 5.1;
membership is `tests/arch/packetwire_files.txt`, read by CMake, the include checker
and the ratchet script, and `tests/arch/packetwire_holdouts.txt` says what keeps
the last one out — `RequestClientPlayerManager.cpp`, which reaches the
whisper queue and the logged-in character). The logging facility (`DebugLog.h`) is in
`basic`, so every library may log; `Client/DebugInfo.h` is the executable's
front end to it and pulls in `MinTr.h`, which is why the libraries may not
include it. The checked formatter (`SafeFormat.h`, `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md`
task 5.4) is in `basic` for the same reason — the call sites that need it are
in the executable, in `VS_UI` and in the packet handlers, and `basic` is the
one library all three link. Game logic compiled straight into the `DarkEden` executable —
including the packet *handlers* under `Client/PacketHandler/` — cannot be linked into
a test binary. That is a structural limit, and it is the single biggest constraint on
how work gets verified here.

`unit_tests` links `basic`, `SpriteLib`, `TextSystem`, `packetwire` and `gamemodel`. Covering
something in `dxlib` or `VS_UI` means adding it to `target_link_libraries` in
`tests/CMakeLists.txt` first. Packet tests construct real packets through the real
factories and pin their bytes against `tests/golden/*.hex` — 54 of those files are
byte-identical copies of the server repo's goldens, so `diff -r` of the two golden
directories is the cross-repo wire check (`tests/unit/test_packet_goldens.cpp` has
the recipe and the `UPDATE_GOLDENS=1` re-record rule).

The **wire-layout inventory** (`tests/unit/test_wire_layout.cpp`,
`tests/wire-layout.txt`): packet id, name and max body size for every factory under
`Client/Packet`, produced from the real factory objects. `tests/tools/gen_wire_inventory.pl`
writes `tests/generated/WireInventory.inc`, one include and one registration per
factory class; the test constructs every factory and its packet (the link proof for
the written CG/CL directions, which no manager ever creates), checks the ids are
unique, and checks that every id `PacketFactoryManager` registers is a listed factory
at the factory's own size. Re-run the generator after adding or changing a factory
(the `wire_inventory_fresh` ctest fails otherwise) and re-record with
`UPDATE_GOLDENS=1`. The server repo commits the same file from its own packet
classes; `server/tests/tools/wire_inventory_diff.sh` diffs the two, and a diff there
is a protocol bug in one repo or the other — see `RESTRUCTURING.md` task 1.4 in the
server repo for the findings and their status. The Rpackets factories are constructed
and checked but kept out of the rendered file, because the server deleted its copies.

### The framework

`tests/framework/test_framework.h` — a minimal self-registering framework, not
GoogleTest. Tests register during static initialisation and `tests/unit/*.cpp` is
globbed, so adding a test means adding a file; there is no runner to edit.

```cpp
TEST(TArray, LoadFromFileRejectsCountLargerThanTheFile)
{
	CHECK_EQ(false, arr.LoadFromFile(truncated));
}
```

`CHECK(expr)` and `CHECK_EQ(expected, actual)` are the whole API. `RunAll()` returns
the failure count, so the exit code is 0 only when the suite is clean.

### How we work

- **Library fixes are written test-first.** Every fix in the remediation table of
  `docs/code-health-review-2026-08-29.md` was.
- **Assert the observable contract, not the crash.** An out-of-bounds read in C++
  usually returns garbage rather than failing an assertion, so a memory-safety test
  asserts the rejected input or the preserved value.
- **Then run the same suite under ASan**, where the invalid access aborts the process.
  Both trees green, or the fix is not verified.
- **Executable-only code has no test path.** It gets verified by running the client
  against a live server. The ten defects under *Runtime defects* in the review were
  all found that way, and none were reachable from a test binary. The seven in the
  short table below them were found by *reading*, during remediation passes, and are
  filed separately for exactly that reason — the heading is a claim about how a
  defect was found, not a bin for anything executable-side.
- A fix that could not be reproduced is called a **regression guard** in its commit
  message, not described as a reproduction.
- Substantial remediation work gets an **adversarial review** afterwards. The last one
  returned "significant problems" and found three real defects the fixes had introduced
  or missed — assume your own fixes deserve the same scrutiny.

### Running them

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/tests -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build/tests --config Debug --target unit_tests -- -m
cd build/tests && ctest -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Add `-DUSE_ASAN=ON` in a separate tree for the sanitized run. `BUILD_TESTS` defaults
to `OFF`, so a tree configured without it generates no test target at all. Current
baseline: **486 tests, 10,604 checks, 0 failed** in both trees.

## Traps

- **`_DEBUG` IS defined in MSVC Debug builds.** `CMakeLists.txt:16` only declines to
  *add* it; MSVC defines it automatically under `/MDd`, which CMake cannot undo. The
  ~50 `#ifdef _DEBUG` blocks in shipped code are therefore **live in every Debug
  build** and dead only in Release. Both directions of this trap have bitten: the
  `_DEBUG`-guarded bounds checks (e.g. `CTypeTable::operator[]`) do run in Debug but
  vanish in Release, and upstream's `_CrtSetDbgFlag(_CRTDBG_DELAY_FREE_MEM_DF)` in
  `Client.cpp` — long believed dead — ran on every Debug launch and made the CRT
  retain every freed block, which presented as a ~200 MB/min in-game "memory leak"
  (root-caused and removed 2026-08-30, see
  `docs/memory-leak-investigation-2026-08-30.md`). Judge every `_DEBUG` guard by the
  build configuration, not by the old doctrine that it never fires.
- **An unlisted DLL kills the client before `main` does anything.** `Client.cpp` walks
  `*.dll` in the working directory against a hardcoded whitelist and does a bare
  `return -1` on the first name it does not recognise — no message, no log line, and
  well before `InitGame()` sets up logging. Adding any library that deploys a new DLL
  beside the executable therefore breaks startup until that DLL is added to the list.
  A silent `-1` exit with no log written is this check until proven otherwise, and note
  that the DLL stays in the output directory after you revert the build change that
  brought it in, so reverting alone does not restore a working tree.
- **Don't launch `DarkEden.exe` yourself** unless asked. It is normally run from the
  Visual Studio debugger, and launching it separately steals the stack trace and locks
  the build output. When a startup failure has to be bisected, ask — running it is
  sometimes the only way to see the exit code, and no test binary can reach that code.
- **Half the shipped data is still packed.** `CRarFile` no longer reads `.rpk` archives
  and needs their contents extracted flat beside them. `Data/ui/txt` and `Data/ui/xml`
  are effectively empty at runtime, so quest data and chat help are absent; lookups
  fail with `[RARFile ERROR]`.
- **The 5:5:5 sprite paths are latent.** `ColorDraw::Is565()` returns a hardcoded
  `true`, so the `CSprite555` family is never constructed and fixes there have no
  runtime effect today.
- **Sprite rejection is silent** — a rejected sprite is dropped with no log line and an
  ignored return value, so bad art would vanish without a signal.

## Conventions

- **Tabs**, not spaces, in C++ sources. There is no `.clang-format` and `make fmt` is a
  stub, so match the surrounding file by hand.
- **English only.** Remaining Korean and Chinese comments are upstream's; translate them
  when you touch that code, and never add more.
- Hungarian notation (`m_pFoo`, `g_pBar`, `bFlag`) and banner comments above functions
  and sections — follow the file you are in.
- Commit messages: `type: lowercase imperative summary`, then prose covering why the
  change is right, what was verified, and what is deliberately out of scope. `a41eec9`
  is the model. A `fix:` commit also carries a `Test path:` line (`lib + test`,
  `moved, then fixed` or `exempt` - `docs/RESTRUCTURING.md` task 3.1); the
  `tools/git-hooks/commit-msg` hook refuses one without, after
  `git config core.hooksPath tools/git-hooks` once per clone. Trailer: `Co-Authored-By: <the authoring model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`, e.g. `Claude Fable 5.1`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `Client/` | game logic — `GameMain`, `MZone`, `MCreature`, `MPlayer`, `MItem`, `MSkill` |
| `Client/Packet/` | the wire layer, compiled once as `packetwire`; `Gpackets/` is server → client |
| `Client/PacketHandler/` | packet handlers, executable-side, bound to ids in `Client/PacketHandlerRegistry.cpp` |
| `Client/SpriteLib/` | sprite decode and blitting, SDL backend, the 555/565 variants |
| `Client/DXLib/` | input, sound and music behind a DirectX-shaped interface, SDL underneath |
| `Client/TextSystem/`, `TextLib/` | UTF-8 text rendering on SDL + freetype2 |
| `Client/D3DLib/` | compatibility stub only; `CDirect3D::GetDevice()` returns `nullptr` |
| `Client/framelib/`, `VolumeLib/`, `DEUtil/`, `MZLib/` | frames, collision, utilities, compression |
| `VS_UI/` | UI framework — widgets, dialogs, skinning, Korean IME |
| `basic/` | memory, exceptions, typedefs, platform abstraction |
| `tests/` | framework and unit tests |
| `docs/` | code health review |
| `참고자료/` | upstream asset notes, non-English, not built |

## Current focus

`docs/code-health-review-2026-08-29.md` holds 197 findings, 85 fixed — every
Critical among them. In priority order:

1. **Unvalidated network input is the top open risk**, and the two halves of it
   now have instruments rather than estimates. `Client/Packet/Gpackets/` passes
   server-supplied lengths, indices and item classes into array subscripts,
   `strcpy`/`sprintf` targets, and a function-pointer table.
   - **Lengths into copies: ratchet R3, at 0.** Every `sprintf`/`strcpy`/`strcat`
     under `Client/Packet` and `Client/PacketHandler` is bounded or gone, so a
     new one fails the suite.
   - **Indices into subscripts: ctest `packet_indices`**, over `Client/Packet`
     and `Client/PacketHandler`. It walks the *value*, not the spelling —
     `array[pPacket->getSlotID()]` has two live instances while
     `int slot = pPacket->getSlotID();` twenty lines above `array[slot]` has a
     hundred. **114** packet-indexed subscripts, 101 of them into a named,
     verified `CTypeTable` that range-checks itself, **13 into a container that
     is not**, all guarded. A fourteenth fails the suite and has to be read.
     It **fails closed**: a container it does not recognise counts as raw, so
     adding a name to its allowlist is a deliberate act. Its first version
     hardcoded the receiver name `pPacket` and so was blind to the 19 handlers
     that call their parameter something else — the same
     measure-the-spelling mistake it was built to answer for R7, which is why
     its header is long.
   - Both passes found live defects, listed under *Found by reading* in the
     review — including one that needs no hostile server at all.
   What remains unaudited is everything the two instruments do not model: a
   length or index that reaches memory by some third route.
2. Fixed-size buffers fed by variable-length server strings (the 21-byte chat rows
   are fixed; 128-byte stack buffers remain in other handlers), and format strings
   loaded from data files passed to sprintf (C19/C20/C22). That last one is
   **closed** (C19, 2026-09-04, task 5.4's fifth slice). **321 sites** are
   converted to `SafeFormat::Format` in `basic/SafeFormat.h`, which checks a
   table entry's conversions against the arguments the call site really passed,
   across `Client`, `VS_UI`, the `AddFormat` family (through
   `CMessageArray::AddSafeFormat`) and `MString::FormatChecked`.
   **Two ratchets hold it, and the pair is the point.** R7 counts a lookup
   *spelled at the format argument*; R8 counts every printf-family call whose
   format is not a string literal, whatever it is spelled as. This file claimed
   C19 was closed once before, for about an hour on 2026-09-04, on R7 alone —
   and 24 live sites were reading the entry out of a static array or a local
   first, invisible to it. **A ratchet at zero is a claim about the ratchet.**
   If you need to know the state of this finding, read the C19 entry in the
   review: it lists five measurements, and R7 is one of them. If you need to
   look for a new site, sweep the *format argument*, never another spelling of
   the lookup.
   `tests/tools/check_format_arity.pl` (ctest `format_arity`) audits every
   converted site against the built-in English table and fails the suite when an
   entry asks for more arguments than its call site passes; it also ratchets how
   many sites it finds *and* how many it resolves, because it has three times
   passed while silently checking less than it should.
3. Dead and duplicate source sitting alongside live code, which is a correctness trap
   when the wrong file gets edited.
