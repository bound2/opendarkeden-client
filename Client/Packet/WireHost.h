//
// The receive loops and the connection managers under Client/Packet are
// otherwise self-contained, but they read three tuning values out of
// the executable's config and send a bug report through its own
// executable's socket. Both are seams to code the library sits below,
// so the library asks for them instead: the executable fills a WireHost
// in and installs it, exactly as MItemHost and MPriceHost work for
// gamemodel.
//
// Every accessor answers without a host. The defaults are the ones
// ClientConfig's own constructor sets, so a binary that never installs
// a host - a test binary - behaves as a client whose config file was
// missing rather than as one whose tuning is zero.

// Pulled out of ClientPlayer::setEncryptCode() so that it can be

// - that nothing defines __USE_ENCRYPTER__, so the encrypted streams
// are never constructed - and that was wrong: Encrypter.h defines it,
// and ClientPlayer.cpp includes SocketEncryptInputStream.h two lines
// before its first #ifdef on it. tests/unit/test_packet_goldens.cpp had
// the truth written down the whole time ("0 is the plain branch, 1..5
// the __USE_ENCRYPTER__ branch"); the claim was made without checking
// against it. Both reviewers of the following slice found it.
//
// So the seed is on the live connection path: GCUpdateInfoHandler calls
// setEncryptCode() right after MoveZone/LoadZone, and the byte it
// derives has to agree with the server's exactly.
//
// The original wrote four branches - Netmarble, Chinese, English, and a
// default - of which three computed the identical expression. Only the
// English one differs, multiplying the server number by 51 where the
// others shift it left by four. That collapse is behaviour-preserving,
// which a test asserts across every server number a byte can hold
// rather than leaving to this comment.
