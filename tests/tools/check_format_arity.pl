# check_format_arity.pl - the check SafeFormat cannot make for itself
#----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# SafeFormat::Format (basic/SafeFormat.h) makes a data-file format string
# safe: a conversion it cannot satisfy is printed as text instead of
# performed. What it cannot do is tell that the entry MEANS what the call
# site passes. A converted site whose entry carries one %s more than the
# call site hands over is no longer a memory-safety defect - but it now
# puts a literal "%s" in the user interface, which is a visible bug where
# the old code merely printed rubbish.
#
# So every conversion done for docs/RESTRUCTURING.md task 5.4 is checked
# here, against the built-in English table in Client/MGameStringTable.cpp.
# That table is not a sample: InitGameStringTable() installs it over the
# file data on the English path, so it is exactly what the default build
# formats with.
#
# What fails this check:
#
#   * an entry with MORE conversions than its call site passes arguments.
#     This is the direction that mattered - it is what made sprintf read a
#     stack word as a char* - and it is the direction that now shows a
#     specifier to the player. It is also the only check here that needs
#     no judgement: both numbers are countable from the text.
#   * a conversion whose argument is provably of the other kind: a %s
#     handed a numeric literal or an arithmetic expression, or a %d handed
#     something with the unmistakable shape of a string (.c_str(),
#     GetString(), a quoted literal).
#
# Deliberately NOT a failure: a %s whose argument this cannot classify.
# The first draft failed those, and reported 29 problems of which every
# one was a false positive - weapon_speed_string[i], szString, grade_string[i]
# are all char arrays that no amount of pattern matching on an expression
# can recognise without a type. A check that guesses cannot be a gate; the
# summary says how many positions went unclassified so the number is at
# least visible.
#
# What is reported but does NOT fail: an entry with FEWER conversions than
# the call site passes. A surplus argument is harmless in both the old and
# the new code, and there are real sites where the English entry takes no
# conversion while the localised one it was written against takes a %s -
# dropping the argument would break the localised build to tidy this one.
#
# What this cannot see: LANGUAGE != 3. No String.inf ships in this
# repository, so for a localised build the entries are unknowable here.
# That build is the one the load-time gate protects and the one the
# formatter's run-time refusal matters most in.

# A check that checked less than it used to must not report OK.
#
# This file has now failed that way three times, which is why the floors
# below are numbers and not a shrug.
#
#   1. A Perl list assignment whose first target was an array left every
#      scalar in split_args undef. No call parsed, all 224 sites fell
#      into the unresolved bucket, and it printed OK.
#   2. It enumerated sources by shelling out to find(1), which under
#      PowerShell is Windows' find.exe. No files, no sites, OK again -
#      and ctest green with a real arity defect in the tree.
#   3. A call was dropped if anything earlier on its line held "//",
#      which a URL in a string literal satisfies.
#
# All three were invisible because nothing pinned the DENOMINATOR. The
# first floor - the site count - was the answer to that, and the review
# round of task 5.4's third slice showed it only half works: renaming
# GetGameString to something else across Client/PacketHandler moved 34
# sites out of "checked" and into "unresolved" while $sites stayed at
# 256, so coverage collapsed and the check still exited 0. Where the
# format sits is decided by spelling (see $fmt_at above), so any future
# call that says `const char* fmt = GetGameString(X); Format(dst, fmt,
# a);` counts toward the site floor and contributes nothing to coverage.
#
# So both numbers are ratcheted. They may rise freely as sites are
# converted; a fall has to be explained by editing these lines in the
# same commit.

# title arrays, three are MString::FormatChecked in GameUI.cpp, and one is
# AllocAskMessage in VS_UI_ExtraDialog.cpp.
#
# That last one stands in for TWENTY-ONE converted call sites and counts
# as one, because it takes the entry as a parameter - exactly the shape
# the paragraph above predicted would count toward the site floor and
# contribute nothing to coverage. So this number is a floor on what the
# audit can see, and NOT the number of converted call sites, which is
# 315 (321 until 2026-09-17). Do not quote it as one.
#
# $MINIMUM_CHECKED moves by 3 rather than 7: the FormatChecked sites name
# their id through GetGameString and resolve, the other four do not.

# quest caption, a block no live event reaches, and six of these with it
# (the hour, minute and second captions, twice); the converted call
# sites are 315.
# 292 and 280 on2026-09-24: R17 cleanup removes the complete obsolete
