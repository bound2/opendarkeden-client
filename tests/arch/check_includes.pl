#----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Walks the quote-include closure of every packetwire member and fails
# on forbidden edges. Perl, not python: the dev machines have Git for
# Windows' perl, and the wire-inventory generator is already perl.
#
# Membership is tests/arch/packetwire_files.txt - the same file the
# CMake target and the ratchet script read, so the three cannot
# disagree about what "the library" is.
#
# Rules:
#   W0  Every .cpp under Client/Packet is listed in exactly one of
#       tests/arch/packetwire_files.txt and
#       tests/arch/packetwire_holdouts.txt, and every listed file
#       exists. The directory is wire-only by construction: a new
#       packet source is a library member unless a holdout line says
#       why not, and a deleted one cannot linger in a list.
#   W1  A file in the packetwire closure may include only files under
#       Client/Packet/ or basic/, or Client/Client_PCH.h (the shared
#       precompiled header - its own includes are walked too). Anything
#       else means game code is reachable from the wire layer. Angle
#       includes are checked too: the library's include path carries
#       Client/, so `#include <MZone.h>` would compile - an angle include
#       that resolves inside the repository is treated exactly like a
#       quoted one; only one that resolves nowhere in the tree is a
#       system header and ignored.
#   W2  The debug facilities whose definitions live in the executable
#       or VS_UI (MinTr.h, DebugInfo.h, DebugKit.h) may not be included
#       anywhere in the closure, so the library stays linkable into a
#       test binary without game stubs.
#
# W1/W2 look at the lines the library's compile actually sees. The
# packet sources are the once-shared client/server copies and still
# carry the server halves behind #ifdef __GAME_SERVER__ /
# #ifndef __GAME_CLIENT__, and those halves include server headers
# that do not exist in this repo. Those macros have exactly one meaning
# in every target of this build (__GAME_CLIENT__ defined, the server
# macros never), so the walk evaluates conditionals on them and skips
# the dead branches; every other macro is unknown and BOTH branches are
# checked. Nothing else is evaluated - an include that is dead only
# under some other macro is still a violation.
#
# An include that cannot be resolved against the search path at all is
# reported as a violation too - a silent skip is how a rule rots.
#
# Grandfathered violations, if ever needed, live one per line in
# tests/arch/baseline.txt as "RULE|includer|include" - the list is
# frozen shrink-only: an entry that stops matching fails the run until
# it is deleted. It is currently empty by design.
